<h2><a name="V3_PREFACE" id="V3_PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Letters may possibly
be found to contain the finest examples
of the language of sentiment and
passion ever presented to the world.
They bear a striking resemblance to
the celebrated romance of Werter,
though the incidents to which they relate
are of a very different cast. Probably
the readers to whom Werter
is incapable of affording pleasure, will
receive no delight from the present
publication. The editor apprehends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-vii" id="Pg_3-vii"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-vii.png">vii</a>]</span>
that, in the judgment of those best
qualified to decide upon the comparison,
these Letters will be admitted to
have the superiority over the fiction of
Goethe. They are the offspring of a
glowing imagination, and a heart penetrated
with the passion it essays to describe.</p>

<p>To the series of letters constituting
the principal article in these two volumes,
are added various pieces, none
of which, it is hoped, will be found
discreditable to the talents of the author.
The slight fragment of Letters on
the Management of Infants, may be
thought a trifle; but it seems to have
some value, as presenting to us with
vividness the intention of the writer on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-viii" id="Pg_3-viii"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
this important subject. The publication
of a few select Letters to Mr.
Johnson, appeared to be at once a just
monument to the sincerity of his friendship,
and a valuable and interesting
specimen of the mind of the writer.
The Letter on the Present Character
of the French Nation, the Extract of
the Cave of Fancy, a Tale, and the
Hints for the Second Part of the Rights
of Woman, may, I believe, safely be
left to speak for themselves. The Essay
on Poetry and our Relish for the Beauties
of Nature, appeared in the Monthly
Magazine for April last, and is the
only piece in this collection which has
previously found its way to the press.</p>

arrangements for our snug dinner to-day,
I have been taken by storm,
and obliged to promise to dine, at
an early hour, with the Miss &mdash;&mdash;s,
the <i>only</i> day they intend to pass here.
I shall however leave the key in the
door, and hope to find you at my
fire-side when I return, about eight
o'clock. Will you not wait for poor
Joan?&mdash;whom you will find better, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-2" id="Pg_3-2"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-2.png">2</a>]</span>

<p><span class="smcap">I obey</span> an emotion of my heart,
which made me think of wishing thee,
my love, good-night! before I go to
rest, with more tenderness than I can
to-morrow, when writing a hasty line
or two under Colonel &mdash;&mdash;'s eye. You
can scarcely imagine with what pleasure
I anticipate the day, when we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-3" id="Pg_3-3"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-3.png">3</a>]</span>
to begin almost to live together; and
you would smile to hear how many
plans of employment I have in my head,
now that I am confident my heart has
found peace in your bosom.&mdash;Cherish
me with that dignified tenderness,
which I have only found in you; and
your own dear girl will try to keep under
a quickness of feeling, that has
sometimes given you pain&mdash;Yes, I will
be <i>good</i>, that I may deserve to be happy;
and whilst you love me, I cannot
again fall into the miserable state, which
rendered life a burthen almost too heavy
to be borne.</p>

<p>But, good-night!&mdash;God bless you!
Sterne says, that is equal to a kiss&mdash;yet
I would rather give you the kiss into
the bargain, glowing with gratitude to
Heaven, and affection to you. I like
the word affection, because it signifies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-4" id="Pg_3-4"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-4.png">4</a>]</span>
something habitual; and we are soon to
meet, to try whether we have mind
enough to keep our hearts warm.</p>

<h4>LETTER III</h4>

<p class="right">Wednesday Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> have often called me, dear girl,
but you would now say good, did you
know how very attentive I have been
to the &mdash;&mdash; ever since I came to Paris.
I am not however going to trouble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-5" id="Pg_3-5"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-5.png">5</a>]</span>
you with the account, because I like to
see your eyes praise me; and, Milton
insinuates, that, during such recitals,
there are interruptions, not ungrateful
to the heart, when the honey that drops
from the lips is not merely words.</p>

<p>Yet, I shall not (let me tell you before
these people enter, to force me to
huddle away my letter) be content with
only a kiss of <span class="smcap">duty</span>&mdash;you <i>must</i> be glad to
see me&mdash;because you are glad&mdash;or I will
make love to the <i>shade</i> of Mirabeau, to
whom my heart continually turned,
whilst I was talking with Madame
&mdash;&mdash;, forcibly telling me, that it will
ever have sufficient warmth to love,
whether I will or not, sentiment, though
I so highly respect principle.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Not that I think Mirabeau utterly
devoid of principles&mdash;Far from it&mdash;and,
if I had not begun to form a new the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-6" id="Pg_3-6"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-6.png">6</a>]</span>ory
respecting men, I should, in the vanity
of my heart, have <i>imagined</i> that <i>I</i>
could have made something of his&mdash;&mdash;it
was composed of such materials&mdash;Hush!
here they come&mdash;and love flies
away in the twinkling of an eye, leaving
a little brush of his wing on my
pale cheeks.</p>

<p>I hope to see Dr. &mdash;&mdash; this morning;
I am going to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s to meet him.
&mdash;&mdash;, and some others, are invited to
dine with us to-day; and to-morrow I
am to spend the day with &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>I shall probably not be able to return
to &mdash;&mdash; to-morrow; but it is no matter,
because I must take a carriage, I
have so many books, that I immediately
want, to take with me.&mdash;On Friday
then I shall expect you to dine
with me&mdash;and, if you come a little before
dinner, it is so long since I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-7" id="Pg_3-7"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-7.png">7</a>]</span>
seen you, you will not be scolded by
yours affectionately</p>

<h4>LETTER IV<a name="FNanchor_7-A_13" id="FNanchor_7-A_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_7-A_13" class="fnanchor">[7-A]</a>.</h4>

<p class="right">Friday Morning [September.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span>, whom a letter from Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
previously announced, called here yesterday
for the payment of a draft; and,
as he seemed disappointed at not finding
you at home, I sent him to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.
I have since seen him, and he tells me
that he has settled the business.</p>

<p>So much for business!&mdash;May I venture
to talk a little longer about less
weighty affairs?&mdash;How are you?&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-8" id="Pg_3-8"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-8.png">8</a>]</span>
have been following you all along the
road this comfortless weather; for,
when I am absent from those I love, my
imagination is as lively, as if my senses
had never been gratified by their presence&mdash;I
was going to say caresses&mdash;and
why should I not? I have found out
that I have more mind than you, in one
respect; because I can, without any
violent effort of reason, find food for
love in the same object, much longer
than you can.&mdash;The way to my senses
is through my heart; but, forgive me!
I think there is sometimes a shorter cut
to yours.</p>

<p>With ninety-nine men out of a hundred,
a very sufficient dash of folly is
necessary to render a woman <i>piquante</i>, a
soft word for desirable; and, beyond
these casual ebullitions of sympathy,
few look for enjoyment by fostering a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-9" id="Pg_3-9"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-9.png">9</a>]</span>
passion in their hearts. One reason, in
short, why I wish my whole sex to become
wiser, is, that the foolish ones
may not, by their pretty folly, rob those
whose sensibility keeps down their vanity,
of the few roses that afford them
some solace in the thorny road of life.</p>

<p>I do not know how I fell into these
reflections, excepting one thought produced
it&mdash;that these continual separations
were necessary to warm your affection.&mdash;Of
late, we are always separating.&mdash;Crack!&mdash;crack!&mdash;and away
you go.&mdash;This joke wears the sallow
cast of thought; for, though I began to
write cheerfully, some melancholy tears
have found their way into my eyes, that
linger there, whilst a glow of tenderness
at my heart whispers that you are one
of the best creatures in the world.&mdash;Pardon
then the vagaries of a mind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-10" id="Pg_3-10"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-10.png">10</a>]</span>
that has been almost "crazed by care,"
as well as "crossed in hapless love,"
and bear with me a <i>little</i> longer!&mdash;When
we are settled in the country together,
more duties will open before me, and
my heart, which now, trembling into
peace, is agitated by every emotion that
awakens the remembrance of old griefs,
will learn to rest on yours, with that
dignity your character, not to talk of
my own, demands.</p>

<p>Take care of yourself&mdash;and write
soon to your own girl (you may add
dear, if you please) who sincerely loves
you, and will try to convince you of it,
by becoming happier.</p>

<h4>LETTER V</h4>

<p class="right">Sunday Night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just received your letter, and
feel as if I could not go to bed tranquilly
without saying a few words in reply&mdash;merely
to tell you, that my mind is serene,
and my heart affectionate.</p>

<p>Ever since you last saw me inclined
to faint, I have felt some gentle twitches,
which make me begin to think, that I
am nourishing a creature who will soon
be sensible of my care.&mdash;This thought
has not only produced an overflowing of
tenderness to you, but made me very
attentive to calm my mind and take
exercise, lest I should destroy an object,
in whom we are to have a mutual interest,
you know. Yesterday&mdash;do not
smile!&mdash;finding that I had hurt myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-12" id="Pg_3-12"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-12.png">12</a>]</span>
by lifting precipitately a large log of
wood, I sat down in an agony, till I felt
those said twitches again.</p>

<p>Are you very busy?</p>

<p>So you may reckon on its being finished
soon, though not before you come
home, unless you are detained longer
than I now allow myself to believe you
will.&mdash;</p>

<p>Be that as it may, write to me, my
best love, and bid me be patient&mdash;kindly&mdash;and
the expressions of kindness
will again beguile the time, as sweetly
as they have done to-night.&mdash;Tell me
also over and over again, that your
happiness (and you deserve to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-13" id="Pg_3-13"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-13.png">13</a>]</span>
happy!) is closely connected with
mine, and I will try to dissipate, as they
rise, the fumes of former discontent,
that have too often clouded the sunshine,
which you have endeavoured to diffuse
through my mind. God bless you!
Take care of yourself, and remember
with tenderness your affectionate</p>

<p class="right">Friday Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> glad to find that other people
can be unreasonable, as well as myself&mdash;for
be it known to thee, that I answered
thy <i>first</i> letter, the very night it
reached me (Sunday), though thou
couldst not receive it before Wednesday,
because it was not sent off till the
next day.&mdash;There is a full, true, and
particular account.&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet I am not angry with thee, my
love, for I think that it is a proof of
stupidity, and likewise of a milk-and-water
affection, which comes to the
same thing, when the temper is governed
by a square and compass.&mdash;There is
nothing picturesque in this straight-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-15" id="Pg_3-15"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-15.png">15</a>]</span>lined
equality, and the passions always
give grace to the actions.</p>

<p>Recollection now makes my heart
bound to thee; but, it is not to thy
money-getting face, though I cannot
be seriously displeased with the exertion
which increases my esteem, or
rather is what I should have expected
from thy character.&mdash;No; I have thy
honest countenance before me&mdash;Pop&mdash;relaxed
by tenderness; a little&mdash;little
wounded by my whims; and thy eyes
glistening with sympathy.&mdash;Thy lips
then feel softer than soft&mdash;and I rest my
cheek on thine, forgetting all the
world.&mdash;I have not left the hue of love
out of the picture&mdash;the rosy glow; and
fancy has spread it over my own cheeks,
I believe, for I feel them burning,
whilst a delicious tear trembles in my
eye, that would be all your own, if a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-16" id="Pg_3-16"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-16.png">16</a>]</span>
grateful emotion directed to the Father
of nature, who has made me thus
alive to happiness, did not give more
warmth to the sentiment it divides&mdash;I
must pause a moment.</p>

<p>Need I tell you that I am tranquil
after writing thus?&mdash;I do not know
why, but I have more confidence in
your affection, when absent, than present;
nay, I think that you must love
me, for, in the sincerity of my heart
let me say it, I believe I deserve your
tenderness, because I am true, and
have a degree of sensibility that you
can see and relish.</p>

I to see you this week, or this
month?&mdash;I do not know what you are
about&mdash;for, as you did not tell me, I
would not ask Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who is generally
pretty communicative.</p>

<p>I long to see Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; not to
hear from you, so do not give yourself
airs, but to get a letter from Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.
And I am half angry with you for not
informing me whether she had brought
one with her or not.&mdash;On this score I
will cork up some of the kind things
that were ready to drop from my pen,
which has never been dipt in gall when
addressing you; or, will only suffer an
exclamation&mdash;"The creature!" or a
kind look, to escape me, when I pass
the slippers&mdash;which I could not remove
from my <i>salle</i> door, though they are
not the handsomest of their kind.</p>

<h4>LETTER VIII</h4>

<p class="right">Monday Night [December 30.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> best love, your letter to-night
was particularly grateful to my heart,
depressed by the letters I received by
&mdash;&mdash;, for he brought me several, and
the parcel of books directed to Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was for me. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s
letter was long and very affectionate;
but the account he gives me of his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-20" id="Pg_3-20"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-20.png">20</a>]</span>
affairs, though he obviously makes the
best of them, has vexed me.</p>

<p>A melancholy letter from my sister
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has also harrassed my mind&mdash;that
from my brother would have given
me sincere pleasure; but for&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a spirit of independence in
his letter, that will please you; and you
shall see it, when we are once more over
the fire together.&mdash;I think that you
would hail him as a brother, with one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-21" id="Pg_3-21"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-21.png">21</a>]</span>
of your tender looks, when your heart
not only gives a lustre to your eye, but
a dance of playfulness, that he would
meet with a glow half made up of bashfulness,
and a desire to please the&mdash;&mdash;where
shall I find a word to express
the relationship which subsists between
us?&mdash;Shall I ask the little twitcher?&mdash;But
I have dropt half the sentence
that was to tell you how much he
would be inclined to love the man loved
by his sister. I have been fancying myself
sitting between you, ever since I
began to write, and my heart has leaped
at the thought!&mdash;You see how I chat
to you.</p>

<p>I did not receive your letter till I
came home; and I did not expect it,
for the post came in much later than
usual. It was a cordial to me&mdash;and I
wanted one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-22" id="Pg_3-22"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-22.png">22</a>]</span>
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; tells me that he has written
again and again.&mdash;Love him a little!&mdash;It
would be a kind of separation, if you
did not love those I love.</p>

<p>There was so much considerate tenderness
in your epistle to-night, that, if
it has not made you dearer to me, it has
made me forcibly feel how very dear
you are to me, by charming away half
my cares.</p>

all your struggles to be manly, have
some of this same sensibility.&mdash;Do not
bid it begone, for I love to see it
striving to master your features; besides,
these kind of sympathies are the life of
affection: and why, in cultivating our

<h4>LETTER X</h4>

<p class="right">Wednesday Night [January 1.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I have been, you tell me, three
days without writing, I ought not to
complain of two: yet, as I expected to
receive a letter this afternoon, I am
hurt; and why should I, by concealing
it, affect the heroism I do not feel?</p>

<p>I hate commerce. How differently
must &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s head and heart be organized
from mine! You will tell me,
that exertions are necessary: I am
weary of them! The face of things,
public and private, vexes me. The
"peace" and clemency which seemed
to be dawning a few days ago, disappear
again. "I am fallen," as Milton said,
"on evil days;" for I really believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-25" id="Pg_3-25"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-25.png">25</a>]</span>
that Europe will be in a state of convulsion,
during half a century at least.
Life is but a labour of patience: it is
always rolling a great stone up a hill;
for, before a person can find a resting-place,
imagining it is lodged, down it
comes again, and all the work is to be
done over anew!</p>

<p>Should I attempt to write any more,
I could not change the strain. My head
aches, and my heart is heavy. The
world appears an "unweeded garden,"
where "things rank and vile" flourish
best.</p>

<p>If you do not return soon&mdash;or, which
is no such mighty matter, talk of it&mdash;I
will throw your slippers out at
window, and be off&mdash;nobody knows
where.</p>

<p>Finding that I was observed, I told
the good women, the two Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;s,
simply that I was with child: and let
them stare! and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
nay, all the world, may know it for
aught I care!&mdash;Yet I wish to avoid
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s coarse jokes.</p>

<p>Considering the care and anxiety a
woman must have about a child before
it comes into the world, it seems to
me, by a <i>natural right</i>, to belong to
her. When men get immersed in the
world, they seem to lose all sensations,
excepting those necessary to continue or
produce life!&mdash;Are these the privileges
of reason? Amongst the feathered race,
whilst the hen keeps the young warm,
her mate stays by to cheer her; but it
is sufficient for man to condescend to
get a child, in order to claim it.&mdash;A
man is a tyrant!</p>

You may now tell me, that, if it were
not for me, you would be laughing
away with some honest fellows in L&mdash;n.
The casual exercise of social sympathy
would not be sufficient for me&mdash;I should
not think such an heartless life worth
preserving.&mdash;It is necessary to be in
good-humour with you, to be pleased
with the world.</p>

<p class="right">Monday Night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just received your kind and
rational letter, and would fain hide my
face, glowing with shame for my folly.&mdash;I
would hide it in your bosom, if you
would again open it to me, and nestle
closely till you bade my fluttering
heart be still, by saying that you forgave
me. With eyes overflowing with
tears, and in the humblest attitude, I
intreat you.&mdash;Do not turn from me, for
indeed I love you fondly, and have been
very wretched, since the night I was so
cruelly hurt by thinking that you had
no confidence in me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is time for me to grow more reasonable,
a few more of these caprices
of sensibility would destroy me. I have,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-29" id="Pg_3-29"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-29.png">29</a>]</span>
in fact, been very much indisposed for
a few days past, and the notion that I
was tormenting, or perhaps killing, a
poor little animal, about whom I am
grown anxious and tender, now I feel
it alive, made me worse. My bowels
have been dreadfully disordered, and
every thing I ate or drank disagreed
with my stomach; still I feel intimations
of its existence, though they have been
fainter.</p>

<p>Do you think that the creature goes
regularly to sleep? I am ready to ask as
many questions as Voltaire's Man of
Forty Crowns. Ah! do not continue to
be angry with me! You perceive that I
am already smiling through my tears&mdash;You
have lightened my heart, and my
frozen spirits are melting into playfulness.</p>

not an angry word&mdash;I cannot now bear
it. Yet, if you think I deserve a scolding

grant), wait till you come back&mdash;and
then, if you are angry one day, I shall
be sure of seeing you the next.</p>

because he talked of going to
H&mdash;&mdash;. Hearing that I was ill, he called
very kindly on me, not dreaming that
it was some words that he incautiously
let fall, which rendered me so.</p>

<p>God bless you, my love; do not shut
your heart against a return of tenderness;
and, as I now in fancy cling to
you, be more than ever my support.&mdash;Feel

cured of quarrelling, begin to encourage
"quick-coming fancies," when
we are separated. Yesterday, my love,
I could not open your letter for some
time; and, though it was not half as
severe as I merited, it threw me into
such a fit of trembling, as seriously
alarmed me. I did not, as you may
suppose, care for a little pain on my
own account; but all the fears which
I have had for a few days past, returned
with fresh force. This morning I am
better; will you not be glad to hear it?
You perceive that sorrow has almost
made a child of me, and that I want to
be soothed to peace.</p>

and imagine that to be coldness
which is just the contrary. For, when
I am hurt by the person most dear to
me, I must let out a whole torrent of
emotions, in which tenderness would
be uppermost, or stifle them altogether;
and it appears to me almost a duty to
stifle them, when I imagine <i>that I am
treated with coldness</i>.</p>

my own &mdash;&mdash;. I know the quickness
of your feelings&mdash;and let me, in the
sincerity of my heart, assure you, there
is nothing I would not suffer to make
you happy. My own happiness wholly

help kissing with more fondness, since
you left us. I think I shall enjoy the
fine prospect, and that it will rather
enliven, than satiate my imagination.</p>

<p>I have called on Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. She
has the manners of a gentlewoman,
with a dash of the easy French coquetry,
which renders her <i>piquante</i>.&mdash;But <i>Monsieur</i>
her husband, whom nature never
dreamed of casting in either the mould
of a gentleman or lover, makes but an
aukward figure in the foreground of
the picture.</p>

<p>The H&mdash;&mdash;s are very ugly, without
doubt&mdash;and the house smelt of commerce
from top to toe&mdash;so that his
abortive attempt to display taste, only
proved it to be one of the things not to
be bought with gold. I was in a room
a moment alone, and my attention was
attracted by the <i>pendule</i>&mdash;A nymph was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-49" id="Pg_3-49"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-49.png">49</a>]</span>
offering up her vows before a smoking
altar, to a fat-bottomed Cupid (saving
your presence), who was kicking his
heels in the air.&mdash;Ah! kick on, thought
I; for the demon of traffic will ever
fright away the loves and graces, that
streak with the rosy beams of infant
fancy the <i>sombre</i> day of life&mdash;whilst the
imagination, not allowing us to see
things as they are, enables us to catch
a hasty draught of the running stream
of delight, the thirst for which seems to
be given only to tantalize us.</p>

<p>But I am philosophizing; nay, perhaps
you will call me severe, and bid
me let the square-headed money-getters
alone.&mdash;Peace to them! though none
of the social sprites (and there are not a
few of different descriptions, who sport
about the various inlets to my heart)
gave me a twitch to restrain my pen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-50" id="Pg_3-50"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-50.png">50</a>]</span>
I have been writing on, expecting
poor &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to come; for, when I
began, I merely thought of business;
and, as this is the idea that most naturally
associates with your image, I wonder
I stumbled on any other.</p>

<p>Yet, as common life, in my opinion,
is scarcely worth having, even with a
<i>gigot</i> every day, and a pudding added
thereunto, I will allow you to cultivate
my judgment, if you will permit me to
keep alive the sentiments in your heart,
which may be termed romantic, because,
the offspring of the senses and
the imagination, they resemble the
mother more than the father<a name="FNanchor_50-A_16" id="FNanchor_50-A_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-A_16" class="fnanchor">[50-A]</a>, when

<p><span class="smcap">I received</span> both your letters to-day&mdash;I
had reckoned on hearing from you
yesterday, therefore was disappointed,
though I imputed your silence to the
right cause. I intended answering
your kind letter immediately, that you
might have felt the pleasure it gave
me; but &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; came in, and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-52" id="Pg_3-52"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-52.png">52</a>]</span>
other things interrupted me; so that
the fine vapour has evaporated&mdash;yet,
leaving a sweet scent behind, I have
only to tell you, what is sufficiently
obvious, that the earnest desire I have
shown to keep my place, or gain more
ground in your heart, is a sure proof
how necessary your affection is to my
happiness.&mdash;Still I do not think it false
delicacy, or foolish pride, to wish that
your attention to my happiness should
arise <i>as much</i> from love, which is always
rather a selfish passion, as reason&mdash;that
is, I want you to promote my
felicity, by seeking your own.&mdash;For,
whatever pleasure it may give me to
discover your generosity of soul, I
would not be dependent for your affection
on the very quality I most admire.
No; there are qualities in your
heart, which demand my affection;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-53" id="Pg_3-53"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-53.png">53</a>]</span>
but, unless the attachment appears to
me clearly mutual, I shall labour only
to esteem your character, instead of
cherishing a tenderness for your person.</p>

<p>I write in a hurry, because the little
one, who has been sleeping a long time,
begins to call for me. Poor thing!
when I am sad, I lament that all my
affections grow on me, till they become
too strong for my peace, though they
all afford me snatches of exquisite enjoyment&mdash;This
for our little girl was at
first very reasonable&mdash;more the effect
of reason, a sense of duty, than feeling&mdash;now,
she has got into my heart
and imagination, and when I walk out
without her, her little figure is ever
dancing before me.</p>

<p>You too have somehow clung round
my heart&mdash;I found I could not eat my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-54" id="Pg_3-54"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-54.png">54</a>]</span>
dinner in the great room&mdash;and, when
I took up the large knife to carve for
myself, tears rushed into my eyes.&mdash;Do
not however suppose that I am melancholy&mdash;for,
when you are from me,
I not only wonder how I can find fault
with you&mdash;but how I can doubt your
affection.</p>

<p>I will not mix any comments on the
inclosed (it roused my indignation)
with the effusion of tenderness, with
which I assure you, that you are the
friend of my bosom, and the prop of my
heart.</p>

<h4>LETTER XXII</h4>

<p class="right">H&mdash;, August 20.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I want</span> to know what steps you
have taken respecting &mdash;&mdash;. Knavery
always rouses my indignation&mdash;I should
be gratified to hear that the law had
chastised &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; severely; but I do not
wish you to see him, because the business
does not now admit of peaceful
discussion, and I do not exactly know
how you would express your contempt.</p>

<p>Pray ask some questions about Tallien&mdash;I
am still pleased with the dignity
of his conduct.&mdash;The other day, in the
cause of humanity, he made use of a
degree of address, which I admire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-56" id="Pg_3-56"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-56.png">56</a>]</span>&mdash;and
mean to point out to you, as one
of the few instances of address which
do credit to the abilities of the man,
without taking away from that confidence
in his openness of heart, which
is the true basis of both public and
private friendship.</p>

<p>Do not suppose that I mean to allude
to a little reserve of temper in you,
of which I have sometimes complained!
You have been used to a
cunning woman, and you almost look
for cunning&mdash;Nay, in <i>managing</i> my
happiness, you now and then wounded
my sensibility, concealing yourself, till
honest sympathy, giving you to me
without disguise, lets me look into a
heart, which my half-broken one wishes
to creep into, to be revived and
cherished.&mdash;&mdash;You have frankness of
heart, but not often exactly that over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-57" id="Pg_3-57"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-57.png">57</a>]</span>flowing
(<i>&eacute;panchement de c&oelig;ur</i>), which
becoming almost childish, appears a
weakness only to the weak.</p>

<p>But I have left poor Tallien. I
wanted you to enquire likewise whether,
as a member declared in the convention,
Robespierre really maintained
a <i>number</i> of mistresses.&mdash;Should it prove
so, I suspect that they rather flattered
his vanity than his senses.</p>

<p>Here is a chatting, desultory epistle!
But do not suppose that I mean to
close it without mentioning the little
damsel&mdash;who has been almost springing
out of my arm&mdash;she certainly looks
very like you&mdash;but I do not love her
the less for that, whether I am angry
or pleased with you.&mdash;</p>

are going by other conveyances, and
which I reckon on your receiving long
before this. I therefore merely write,
because I know I should be disappointed
at seeing any one who had left you,
if you did not send a letter, were it ever
so short, to tell me why you did not
write a longer&mdash;and you will want to
be told, over and over again, that our

three other things, which delight her&mdash;to
ride in a coach, to look at a scarlet
waistcoat, and hear loud music&mdash;yesterday,
at the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, she enjoyed the two
latter; but, to honour J. J. Rousseau,
I intend to give her a sash, the first she
has ever had round her&mdash;and why not?&mdash;for
I have always been half in love
with him.</p>

<p>Well, this you will say is trifling&mdash;shall
I talk about alum or soap? There
is nothing picturesque in your present
pursuits; my imagination then rather
chuses to ramble back to the barrier
with you, or to see you coming to
meet me, and my basket of grapes.&mdash;With
what pleasure do I recollect your
looks and words, when I have been
sitting on the window, regarding the
waving corn!</p>

Believe me, sage sir, you have not
sufficient respect for the imagination&mdash;I
could prove to you in a trice that it is
the mother of sentiment, the great
distinction of our nature, the only purifier
of the passions&mdash;animals have a
portion of reason, and equal, if not
more exquisite, senses; but no trace of
imagination, or her offspring taste, appears
in any of their actions. The impulse
of the senses, passions, if you will,
and the conclusions of reason, draw
men together; but the imagination is
the true fire, stolen from heaven, to
animate this cold creature of clay, producing
all those fine sympathies that
lead to rapture, rendering men social
by expanding their hearts, instead of
leaving them leisure to calculate how
many comforts society affords.</p>

be tantamount to nonsensical, I shall

by trade, and the vulgar enjoyments of
life&mdash;Bring me then back your barrier-face,

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been playing and laughing
with the little girl so long, that I cannot
take up my pen to address you
without emotion. Pressing her to my
bosom, she looked so like you (<i>entre

your commercial face) every nerve
seemed to vibrate to the touch, and I
began to think that there was something
in the assertion of man and wife
being one&mdash;for you seemed to pervade
my whole frame, quickening the beat

my packet of letters. He called on me
before; and I like him better than I
did&mdash;that is, I have the same opinion
of his understanding, but I think with
you, he has more tenderness and real
delicacy of feeling with respect to women,
than are commonly to be met with.
His manner too of speaking of his little
girl, about the age of mine, interested
me. I gave him a letter for my sister,
and requested him to see her.</p>

Public affairs I do not descant on, except
to tell you that they write now
with great freedom and truth, and this
liberty of the press will overthrow the
Jacobins, I plainly perceive.</p>

<p>I hope you take care of your health.
I have got a habit of restlessness at
night, which arises, I believe, from
activity of mind; for, when I am alone,
that is, not near one to whom I can
open my heart, I sink into reveries and
trains of thinking, which agitate and
fatigue me.</p>

<p>This is my third letter; when am I
to hear from you? I need not tell you,
I suppose, that I am now writing with
somebody in the room with me, and
&mdash;&mdash; is waiting to carry this to Mr.

you, and bid you adieu.</p>

letters, to bring back to me your barrier-face&mdash;or
that you should not be
loved by my barrier-girl. I know that
you will love her more and more, for
she is a little affectionate, intelligent
creature, with as much vivacity, I
should think, as you could wish for.</p>

<p>I was going to tell you of two or
three things which displease me here;
but they are not of sufficient consequence
to interrupt pleasing sensations.
I have received a letter from
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. I want you to bring &mdash;&mdash;
with you. Madame S&mdash;&mdash; is by me,
reading a German translation of your
letters&mdash;she desires me to give her love

she is a sweet little creature; for, setting
aside a mother's fondness (which,

last absence. You are then a dear
affectionate creature, and I will not
plague you. The letter which you
chance to receive, when the absence is
so long, ought to bring only tears of
tenderness, without any bitter alloy,
into your eyes.</p>

<p>After your return I hope indeed,
that you will not be so immersed in
business, as during the last three or
four months past&mdash;for even money, taking
into the account all the future comforts
it is to procure, may be gained at
too dear a rate, if painful impressions
are left on the mind.&mdash;These impressions
were much more lively, soon after
you went away, than at present&mdash;for a
thousand tender recollections efface the
melancholy traces they left on my mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-71" id="Pg_3-71"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-71.png">71</a>]</span>&mdash;and
every emotion is on the same side
as my reason, which always was on
yours.&mdash;Separated, it would be almost
impious to dwell on real or imaginary
imperfections of character.&mdash;I feel that
I love you; and, if I cannot be happy
with you, I will seek it no where else.</p>

<p>My little darling grows every day
more dear to me&mdash;and she often has a
kiss, when we are alone together,
which I give her for you, with all my
heart.</p>

<p>I have been interrupted&mdash;and must
send off my letter. The liberty of the
press will produce a great effect here&mdash;the
<i>cry of blood will not be vain</i>!&mdash;Some
more monsters will perish&mdash;and the
Jacobins are conquered.&mdash;Yet I almost
fear the last slap of the tail of the
beast.</p>

<p>I have had several trifling teazing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-72" id="Pg_3-72"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-72.png">72</a>]</span>
inconveniencies here, which I shall not
now trouble you with a detail of.&mdash;I
am sending &mdash;&mdash; back; her pregnancy
rendered her useless. The girl I have
got has more vivacity, which is better
for the child.</p>

<p>I long to hear from you.&mdash;Bring a
copy of &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; with you.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; is still here: he is a lost man.&mdash;He
really loves his wife, and is anxious
about his children; but his indiscriminate
hospitality and social feelings have
given him an inveterate habit of drinking,
that destroys his health, as well as
renders his person disgusting.&mdash;If his
wife had more sense, or delicacy, she
might restrain him: as it is, nothing
will save him.</p>

<p>Yours most truly and affectionately</p>

<h4>LETTER XXVII</h4>

<p class="right">October 26.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> dear love, I began to wish so earnestly
to hear from you, that the sight
of your letters occasioned such pleasurable
emotions, I was obliged to throw
them aside till the little girl and I were
alone together; and this said little girl,
our darling, is become a most intelligent
little creature, and as gay as a lark,
and that in the morning too, which I
do not find quite so convenient. I
once told you, that the sensations before
she was born, and when she is
sucking, were pleasant; but they do
not deserve to be compared to the emotions
I feel, when she stops to smile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-74" id="Pg_3-74"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-74.png">74</a>]</span>
upon me, or laughs outright on meeting
me unexpectedly in the street, or
after a short absence. She has now the
advantage of having two good nurses,
and I am at present able to discharge
my duty to her, without being the
slave of it.</p>

<p>I have therefore employed and amused
myself since I got rid of &mdash;&mdash;, and am
making a progress in the language
amongst other things. I have also made
some new acquaintance. I have almost
<i>charmed</i> a judge of the tribunal, R&mdash;&mdash;,
who, though I should not have thought
it possible, has humanity, if not <i>beaucoup
d'esprit</i>. But let me tell you, if you do
not make haste back, I shall be half in
love with the author of the <i>Marseillaise</i>,
who is a handsome man, a little
too broad-faced or so, and plays sweetly
on the violin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-75" id="Pg_3-75"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-75.png">75</a>]</span>
What do you say to this threat?&mdash;why,
<i>entre nous</i>, I like to give way to
a sprightly vein, when writing to you,
that is, when I am pleased with you.
"The devil," you know, is proverbially
said to be "in a good humour, when
he is pleased." Will you not then be
a good boy, and come back quickly to
play with your girls? but I shall not allow
you to love the new-comer best.</p>

such a manner, that it will not be necessary
for you to leave us soon again;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-76" id="Pg_3-76"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-76.png">76</a>]</span>

I want to be sure that you are safe&mdash;and
not separated from me by a sea that
must be passed. For, feeling that I am
happier than I ever was, do you wonder
at my sometimes dreading that fate
has not done persecuting me? Come
to me, my dearest friend, husband, father
of my child!&mdash;All these fond ties
glow at my heart at this moment, and
dim my eyes.&mdash;With you an independence
is desirable; and it is always

us&mdash;without you the world again appears
empty to me. But I am recurring
to some of the melancholy thoughts
that have flitted across my mind for
some days past, and haunted my
dreams.</p>

<p>My little darling is indeed a sweet
child; and I am sorry that you are not
here, to see her little mind unfold itself.
You talk of "dalliance;" but certainly
no lover was ever more attached to his
mistress, than she is to me. Her eyes
follow me every where, and by affection
I have the most despotic power
over her. She is all vivacity or softness&mdash;yes;
I love her more than I
thought I should. When I have been
hurt at your stay, I have embraced her
as my only comfort&mdash;when pleased with
you, for looking and laughing like
you; nay, I cannot, I find, long be an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-79" id="Pg_3-79"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-79.png">79</a>]</span>gry

be no end to these details. Fold us
both to your heart; for I am truly and

<p>I do, my love, indeed sincerely

are well, and think of me with affec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-80" id="Pg_3-80"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-80.png">80</a>]</span>tion,
I only lament other disappointments,

should thus exert yourself in vain, and
that you are kept from me.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I know, urges you to stay,
and is continually branching out into
new projects, because he has the idle
desire to amass a large fortune, rather
an immense one, merely to have the
credit of having made it. But we
who are governed by other motives,

we meet, we will discuss this subject&mdash;You
will listen to reason, and it has
probably occurred to you, that it will
be better, in future, to pursue some
sober plan, which may demand more
time, and still enable you to arrive at
the same end. It appears to me absurd
to waste life in preparing to live.</p>

your business in such a manner
as to avoid the inquietudes, of which
I have had my share since your departure?
Is it not possible to enter into
business, as an employment necessary
to keep the faculties awake, and (to
sink a little in the expressions) the pot
boiling, without suffering what must
ever be considered as a secondary object,
to engross the mind, and drive
sentiment and affection out of the
heart?</p>

counteract, in some measure, what
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he he'">he</ins> has doubtless recommended most
warmly.</p>

<p>Stay, my friend, whilst it is <i>absolutely</i>

name, though it glows at my heart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-82" id="Pg_3-82"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-82.png">82</a>]</span>
unless you come the moment the settling

consent</i> to your taking any other journey&mdash;or
the little woman and I will be

had rather owe every thing to your affection,
and, I may add, to your reason,
(for this immoderate desire of
wealth, which makes &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; so eager
to have you remain, is contrary to your
principles of action), I will not importune
you.&mdash;I will only tell you, that I
long to see you&mdash;and, being at peace
with you, I shall be hurt, rather than
made angry, by delays.&mdash;Having suffered
so much in life, do not be surprised
if I sometimes, when left to
myself, grow gloomy, and suppose that
it was all a dream, and that my happiness
is not to last. I say happiness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-83" id="Pg_3-83"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-83.png">83</a>]</span>

<p>How I hate this crooked business!
This intercourse with the world, which
obliges one to see the worst side of
human nature! Why cannot you be
content with the object you had first in
view, when you entered into this wearisome
labyrinth?&mdash;I know very well
that you have imperceptibly been
drawn on; yet why does one project,
successful or abortive, only give place
to two others? Is it not sufficient to
avoid poverty?&mdash;I am contented to do
my part; and, even here, sufficient to
escape from wretchedness is not difficult
to obtain. And, let me tell you,
I have my project also&mdash;and, if you do
not soon return, the little girl and I
will take care of ourselves; we will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-85" id="Pg_3-85"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-85.png">85</a>]</span>
accept any of your cold kindness&mdash;your
distant civilities&mdash;no; not we.</p>

<p>This is but half jesting, for I am
really tormented by the desire which
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; manifests to have you remain
where you are.&mdash;Yet why do I talk to
you?&mdash;If he can persuade you&mdash;let him!&mdash;for,
if you are not happier with me,
and your own wishes do not make you
throw aside these eternal projects, I am
above using any arguments, though
reason as well as affection seems to offer
them&mdash;if our affection be mutual,
they will occur to you&mdash;and you will
act accordingly.</p>

<p>Since my arrival here, I have found
the German lady, of whom you have
heard me speak. Her first child died
in the month; but she has another,
about the age of my &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a fine
little creature. They are still but con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-86" id="Pg_3-86"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-86.png">86</a>]</span>triving
to live&mdash;&mdash;earning their daily
bread&mdash;yet, though they are but just
above poverty, I envy them.&mdash;She is a
tender, affectionate mother&mdash;fatigued
even by her attention.&mdash;However she
has an affectionate husband in her turn,
to render her care light, and to share
her pleasure.</p>

<p>I will own to you that, feeling extreme
tenderness for my little girl, I
grow sad very often when I am playing
with her, that you are not here, to
observe with me how her mind unfolds,
and her little heart becomes attached!&mdash;These
appear to me to be true pleasures&mdash;and
still you suffer them to escape
you, in search of what we may
never enjoy.&mdash;It is your own maxim to
"live in the present moment."&mdash;<i>If you
do</i>&mdash;stay, for God's sake; but tell me
the truth&mdash;if not, tell me when I may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-87" id="Pg_3-87"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-87.png">87</a>]</span>
expect to see you, and let me not be
always vainly looking for you, till I
grow sick at heart.</p>

take my darling to my bosom to comfort
me.</p>

<p class="right">December 30.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Should</span> you receive three or four of
the letters at once which I have written
lately, do not think of Sir John
Brute, for I do not mean to wife you.
I only take advantage of every occasion,
that one out of three of my

angry, of the necessity of your staying
two or three months longer. I do not
like this life of continual inquietude&mdash;and,

to earn some money here myself, in
order to convince you that, if you
chuse to run about the world to get a
fortune, it is for yourself&mdash;for the little
girl and I will live without your assistance,
unless you are with us. I may
be termed proud&mdash;Be it so&mdash;but I will
never abandon certain principles of
action.</p>

<p>The common run of men have such
an ignoble way of thinking, that, if
they debauch their hearts, and prostitute
their persons, following perhaps a
gust of inebriation, they suppose the
wife, slave rather, whom they main<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-89" id="Pg_3-89"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-89.png">89</a>]</span>tain,

ought to receive the sultan, whenever
he deigns to return, with open arms,
though his have been polluted by half
an hundred promiscuous amours during
his absence.</p>

<p>I consider fidelity and constancy as
two distinct things; yet the former is
necessary, to give life to the other&mdash;and
such a degree of respect do I think
due to myself, that, if only probity,
which is a good thing in its place,
brings you back, never return!&mdash;for,
if a wandering of the heart, or even a
caprice of the imagination detains
you&mdash;there is an end of all my hopes of
happiness&mdash;I could not forgive it, if I
would.</p>

<p>I have gotten into a melancholy
mood, you perceive. You know my
opinion of men in general; you know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-90" id="Pg_3-90"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-90.png">90</a>]</span>
that I think them systematic tyrants, and
that it is the rarest thing in the world,
to meet with a man with sufficient
delicacy of feeling to govern desire.
When I am thus sad, I lament that my
little darling, fondly as I doat on her,
is a girl.&mdash;I am sorry to have a tie to a
world that for me is ever sown with
thorns.</p>

<p>You will call this an ill-humoured
letter, when, in fact, it is the strongest
proof of affection I can give, to dread
to lose you. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has taken such
pains to convince me that you must
and ought to stay, that it has inconceivably
depressed my spirits&mdash;You
have always known my opinion&mdash;I have
ever declared, that two people, who
mean to live together, ought not to be
long separated.&mdash;If certain things are

shall never hear of me more.&mdash;If not&mdash;for
God's sake, let us struggle with
poverty&mdash;with any evil, but these continual
inquietudes of business, which
I have been told were to last but a few
months, though every day the end appears
more distant! This is the first
letter in this strain that I have determined
to forward to you; the rest lie
by, because I was unwilling to give you
pain, and I should not now write, if I
did not think that there would be no
conclusion to the schemes, which demand,
as I am told, your presence.</p>

<p class="right">January 9.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I just</span> now received one of your
hasty <i>notes</i>; for business so entirely occupies
you, that you have not time, or
sufficient command of thought, to write
letters. Beware! you seem to be got
into a whirl of projects and schemes,
which are drawing you into a gulph,
that, if it do not absorb your happiness,
will infallibly destroy mine.</p>

<p>Fatigued during my youth by the
most arduous struggles, not only to obtain
independence, but to render myself
useful, not merely pleasure, for
which I had the most lively taste, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-93" id="Pg_3-93"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-93.png">93</a>]</span>
mean the simple pleasures that flow from
passion and affection, escaped me, but
the most melancholy views of life were
impressed by a disappointed heart on
my mind. Since I knew you, I have
been endeavouring to go back to my
former nature, and have allowed some
time to glide away, winged with the
delight which only spontaneous enjoyment
can give.&mdash;Why have you so
soon dissolved the charm?</p>

<p>I am really unable to bear the continual
inquietude which your and
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s never-ending plans produce.
This you may term want of firmness&mdash;but
you are mistaken&mdash;I have still sufficient
firmness to pursue my principle
of action. The present misery, I cannot
find a softer word to do justice to
my feelings, appears to me unneces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-94" id="Pg_3-94"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-94.png">94</a>]</span>sary&mdash;and
therefore I have not firmness
to support it as you may think I
ought. I should have been content,
and still wish, to retire with you to a
farm&mdash;My God! any thing, but these
continual anxieties&mdash;any thing but
commerce, which debases the mind,
and roots out affection from the heart.</p>

<p>I do not mean to complain of subordinate
inconveniences&mdash;&mdash;yet I will
simply observe, that, led to expect
you every week, I did not make the
arrangements required by the present
circumstances, to procure the necessaries
of life. In order to have them,
a servant, for that purpose only, is indispensible&mdash;The
want of wood, has made
me catch the most violent cold I ever
had; and my head is so disturbed by
continual coughing, that I am unable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-95" id="Pg_3-95"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-95.png">95</a>]</span>
to write without stopping frequently to
recollect myself.&mdash;This however is one
of the common evils which must be
borne with&mdash;&mdash;bodily pain does not
touch the heart, though it fatigues the
spirits.</p>

<p>Still as you talk of your return, even
in February, doubtingly, I have determined,
the moment the weather
changes, to wean my child.&mdash;It is too
soon for her to begin to divide sorrow!&mdash;And
as one has well said, "despair is a
freeman," we will go and seek our fortune
together.</p>

<p>This is not a caprice of the moment&mdash;for
your absence has given new
weight to some conclusions, that I was
very reluctantly forming before you
left me.&mdash;I do not chuse to be a secondary
object.&mdash;If your feelings were
in unison with mine, you would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-96" id="Pg_3-96"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-96.png">96</a>]</span>

say simply, that it is pleasant to forgive
those we love. I have received your
two letters, dated the 26th and 28th
of December, and my anger died away.
You can scarcely conceive the effect
some of your letters have produced on
me. After longing to hear from you
during a tedious interval of suspense,
I have seen a superscription written by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-97" id="Pg_3-97"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-97.png">97</a>]</span>
you.&mdash;Promising myself pleasure, and
feeling emotion, I have laid it by me,
till the person who brought it, left the
room&mdash;when, behold! on opening it,
I have found only half a dozen hasty
lines, that have damped all the rising
affection of my soul.</p>

<p>Well, now for business&mdash;</p>

<p>My animal is well; I have not yet
taught her to eat, but nature is doing
the business. I gave her a crust to assist
the cutting of her teeth; and now
she has two, she makes good use of
them to gnaw a crust, biscuit, &amp;c. You
would laugh to see her; she is just like
a little squirrel; she will guard a crust
for two hours; and, after fixing her
eye on an object for some time, dart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-98" id="Pg_3-98"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-98.png">98</a>]</span>
on it with an aim as sure as a bird of
prey&mdash;nothing can equal her life and
spirits. I suffer from a cold; but it
does not affect her. Adieu! do not
forget to love us&mdash;and come soon to
tell us that you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the purport of your last letters,
I would suppose that this will

<p>For my part, my head is turned giddy,
by only hearing of plans to make
money, and my contemptuous feelings
have sometimes burst out. I therefore
was glad that a violent cold gave me a
pretext to stay at home, lest I should
have uttered unseasonable truths.</p>

<p>My child is well, and the spring
will perhaps restore me to myself.&mdash;I
have endured many inconveniences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-100" id="Pg_3-100"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-100.png">100</a>]</span>
this winter, which should I be ashamed
to mention, if they had been unavoidable.
"The secondary pleasures of life,"
you say, "are very necessary to my comfort:"
it may be so; but I have ever
considered them as secondary. If therefore
you accuse me of wanting the resolution
necessary to bear the <i>common</i><a name="FNanchor_100-A_19" id="FNanchor_100-A_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_100-A_19" class="fnanchor">[100-A]</a>

<h4>LETTER XXXV</h4>

<p class="right">February 9.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> melancholy presentiment has for
some time hung on my spirits, that we
were parted for ever; and the letters I
received this day, by Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, convince
me that it was not without foundation.
You allude to some other
letters, which I suppose have miscarried;
for most of those I have got, were
only a few hasty lines, calculated to
wound the tenderness the sight of the
superscriptions excited.</p>

<p>I mean not however to complain;
yet so many feelings are struggling for
utterance, and agitating a heart almost
bursting with anguish, that I find it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-102" id="Pg_3-102"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-102.png">102</a>]</span>
very difficult to write with any degree
of coherence.</p>

<p>You left me indisposed, though you
have taken no notice of it; and the
most fatiguing journey I ever had, contributed
to continue it. However, I
recovered my health; but a neglected
cold, and continual inquietude during
the last two months, have reduced me
to a state of weakness I never before
experienced. Those who did not know
that the canker-worm was at work at
the core, cautioned me about suckling
my child too long.&mdash;God preserve this
poor child, and render her happier
than her mother!</p>

<p>But I am wandering from my subject:
indeed my head turns giddy, when I
think that all the confidence I have had
in the affection of others is come to this.</p>

<p>I did not expect this blow from you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-103" id="Pg_3-103"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-103.png">103</a>]</span>
I have done my duty to you and my
child; and if I am not to have any
return of affection to reward me, I
have the sad consolation of knowing
that I deserved a better fate. My
soul is weary&mdash;I am sick at heart; and,
but for this little darling, I would
cease to care about a life, which is now
stripped of every charm.</p>

<p>You see how stupid I am, uttering
declamation, when I meant simply to
tell you, that I consider your requesting
me to come to you, as merely dictated
by honour.&mdash;Indeed, I scarcely understand
you.&mdash;You request me to come,
and then tell me, that you have not
given up all thoughts of returning to
this place.</p>

<p>When I determined to live with you,
I was only governed by affection.&mdash;I
would share poverty with you, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-104" id="Pg_3-104"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-104.png">104</a>]</span>
turn with affright from the sea of trouble
on which you are entering.&mdash;I have
certain principles of action: I know
what I look for to found my happiness
on.&mdash;It is not money.&mdash;With you I
wished for sufficient to procure the
comforts of life&mdash;as it is, less will
do.&mdash;I can still exert myself to
obtain the necessaries of life for my
child, and she does not want more at
present.&mdash;I have two or three plans in
my head to earn our subsistence; for
do not suppose that, neglected by you,
I will lie under obligations of a pecuniary
kind to you!&mdash;No; I would sooner
submit to menial service.&mdash;I wanted the
support of your affection&mdash;that gone,
all is over!&mdash;I did not think, when I
complained of &mdash;&mdash;'s contemptible avidity
to accumulate money, that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-105" id="Pg_3-105"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-105.png">105</a>]</span>
would have dragged you into his
schemes.</p>

<p>I cannot write.&mdash;I inclose a fragment
of a letter, written soon after your
departure, and another which tenderness
made me keep back when it was
written.&mdash;You will see then the sentiments
of a calmer, though not a more
determined, moment.&mdash;Do not insult
me by saying, that "our being together
is paramount to every other consideration!"
Were it, you would not be
running after a bubble, at the expence
of my peace of mind.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the last letter you will
ever receive from me.</p>

<h4>LETTER XXXVI</h4>

<p class="right">Feb. 10.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> talk of "permanent views and
future comfort"&mdash;not for me, for I am
dead to hope. The inquietudes of the
last winter have finished the business,
and my heart is not only broken, but
my constitution destroyed. I conceive
myself in a galloping consumption, and
the continual anxiety I feel at the
thought of leaving my child, feeds the
fever that nightly devours me. It is
on her account that I again write to
you, to conjure you, by all that you
hold sacred, to leave her here with the
German lady you may have heard me
mention! She has a child of the same
age, and they may be brought up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-107" id="Pg_3-107"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-107.png">107</a>]</span>gether,
as I wish her to be brought up.
I shall write more fully on the subject.
To facilitate this, I shall give up my
present lodgings, and go into the same
house. I can live much cheaper there,
which is now become an object. I have
had 3000 livres from &mdash;&mdash;, and I shall
take one more, to pay my servant's
wages, &amp;c. and then I shall endeavour
to procure what I want by my own exertions.
I shall entirely give up the acquaintance
of the Americans.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; and I have not been on good
terms a long time. Yesterday he very
unmanlily exulted over me, on account
of your determination to stay. I had
provoked it, it is true, by some asperities
against commerce, which have
dropped from me, when we have argued
about the propriety of your remaining
where you are; and it is no matter, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-108" id="Pg_3-108"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-108.png">108</a>]</span>
have drunk too deep of the bitter cup
to care about trifles.</p>

<p>When you first entered into these
plans, you bounded your views to the
gaining of a thousand pounds. It was
sufficient to have procured a farm in
America, which would have been an
independence. You find now that you
did not know yourself, and that a certain
situation in life is more necessary
to you than you imagined&mdash;more necessary
than an uncorrupted heart&mdash;For
a year or two, you may procure yourself
what you call pleasure; eating,
drinking, and women; but, in the solitude
of declining life, I shall be remembered
with regret&mdash;I was going to
say with remorse, but checked my
pen.</p>

<p>As I have never concealed the nature of
my connection with you, your repu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-109" id="Pg_3-109"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-109.png">109</a>]</span>tation
will not suffer. I shall never have
a confident: I am content with the approbation
of my own mind; and, if there
be a searcher of hearts, mine will not
be despised. Reading what you have
written relative to the desertion of women,
I have often wondered how theory
and practice could be so different, till
I recollected, that the sentiments of
passion, and the resolves of reason, are
very distinct. As to my sisters, as you
are so continually hurried with business,
you need not write to them&mdash;I
shall, when my mind is calmer. God
bless you! Adieu!</p>

<p class="right">* * * *</p>

<p>This has been such a period of barbarity
and misery, I ought not to complain
of having my share. I wish one
moment that I had never heard of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-110" id="Pg_3-110"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-110.png">110</a>]</span>
cruelties that have been practised here,
and the next envy the mothers who
have been killed with their children.
Surely I had suffered enough in life,
not to be cursed with a fondness, that
burns up the vital stream I am imparting.
You will think me mad: I
would I were so, that I could forget
my misery&mdash;so that my head or heart
would be still.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>LETTER XXXVII</h4>

<p class="right">Feb. 19.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I first received your letter,
putting off your return to an indefinite
time, I felt so hurt, that I know not
what I wrote. I am now calmer,
though it was not the kind of wound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-111" id="Pg_3-111"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-111.png">111</a>]</span>
over which time has the quickest effect;
on the contrary, the more I think, the
sadder I grow. Society fatigues me inexpressibly&mdash;So
much so, that finding
fault with every one, I have only reason
enough, to discover that the fault is
in myself. My child alone interests
me, and, but for her, I should not take
any pains to recover my health.</p>

<p>As it is, I shall wean her, and try if
by that step (to which I feel a repugnance,
for it is my only solace) I can
get rid of my cough. Physicians talk
much of the danger attending any complaint
on the lungs, after a woman has
suckled for some months. They lay a
stress also on the necessity of keeping
the mind tranquil&mdash;and, my God! how
has mine been harrassed! But whilst
the caprices of other women are gratified,
"the wind of heaven not suffered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-112" id="Pg_3-112"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-112.png">112</a>]</span>
to visit them too rudely," I have not
found a guardian angel, in heaven or
on earth, to ward off sorrow or care
from my bosom.</p>

<p>What sacrifices have you not made
for a woman you did not respect!&mdash;But
I will not go over this ground&mdash;I want
to tell you that I do not understand
you. You say that you have not given
up all thoughts of returning here&mdash;and
I know that it will be necessary&mdash;nay,
is. I cannot explain myself; but if you
have not lost your memory, you will
easily divine my meaning. What! is
our life then only to be made up of separations?
and am I only to return to
a country, that has not merely lost all
charms for me, but for which I feel a
repugnance that almost amounts to
horror, only to be left there a prey to
it!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-113" id="Pg_3-113"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-113.png">113</a>]</span>
Why is it so necessary that I should
return?&mdash;brought up here, my girl
would be freer. Indeed, expecting you
to join us, I had formed some plans
of usefulness that have now vanished
with my hopes of happiness.</p>

<p>In the bitterness of my heart, I could
complain with reason, that I am left
here dependent on a man, whose avidity
to acquire a fortune has rendered
him callous to every sentiment connected
with social or affectionate emotions.&mdash;With
a brutal insensibility, he
cannot help displaying the pleasure
your determination to stay gives him,
in spite of the effect it is visible it has
had on me.</p>

<p>Till I can earn money, I shall endeavour
to borrow some, for I want to
avoid asking him continually for the
sum necessary to maintain me.&mdash;Do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-114" id="Pg_3-114"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-114.png">114</a>]</span>
mistake me, I have never been refused.&mdash;Yet
I have gone half a dozen times
to the house to ask for it, and come
away without speaking&mdash;&mdash;you must
guess why&mdash;Besides, I wish to avoid
hearing of the eternal projects to which
you have sacrificed my peace&mdash;not remembering&mdash;but
I will be silent for
ever.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>LETTER XLIV</h4>

<p class="right">Friday, June 12.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just received yours dated the
9th, which I suppose was a mistake, for
it could scarcely have loitered so long
on the road. The general observations
which apply to the state of your own
mind, appear to me just, as far as they
go; and I shall always consider it as
one of the most serious misfortunes of
my life, that I did not meet you, before
satiety had rendered your senses so fastidious,
as almost to close up every tender
avenue of sentiment and affection
that leads to your sympathetic heart.
You have a heart, my friend, yet, hurried
away by the impetuosity of inferior
feelings, you have sought in vulgar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-128" id="Pg_3-128"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-128.png">128</a>]</span>
excesses, for that gratification which
only the heart can bestow.</p>

<p>The common run of men, I know,
with strong health and gross appetites,
must have variety to banish <i>ennui</i>, because
the imagination never lends its
magic wand, to convert appetite into
love, cemented by according reason.&mdash;Ah!
my friend, you know not the ineffable
delight, the exquisite pleasure,
which arises from a unison of affection
and desire, when the whole soul and
senses are abandoned to a lively imagination,
that renders every emotion delicate
and rapturous. Yes; these are
emotions, over which satiety has no
power, and the recollection of which,
even disappointment cannot disenchant;
but they do not exist without self-denial.
These emotions, more or less
strong, appear to me to be the distinc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-129" id="Pg_3-129"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-129.png">129</a>]</span>tive
characteristic of genius, the foundation
of taste, and of that exquisite
relish for the beauties of nature, of
which the common herd of eaters and
drinkers and <i>child-begeters</i>, certainly
have no idea. You will smile at an
observation that has just occurred to me:&mdash;I
consider those minds as the most
strong and original, whose imagination
acts as the stimulus to their senses.</p>

<p>Well! you will ask, what is the result
of all this reasoning? Why I cannot
help thinking that it is possible for
you, having great strength of mind,
to return to nature, and regain a sanity
of constitution, and purity of feeling&mdash;which
would open your heart to me.&mdash;I
would fain rest there!</p>

<p>Yet, convinced more than ever of
the sincerity and tenderness of my attachment
to you, the involuntary hopes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-130" id="Pg_3-130"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-130.png">130</a>]</span>
which a determination to live has revived,
are not sufficiently strong to dissipate
the cloud, that despair has spread
over futurity. I have looked at the
sea, and at my child, hardly daring to
own to myself the secret wish, that it
might become our tomb; and that the
heart, still so alive to anguish, might
there be quieted by death. At this
moment ten thousand complicated sentiments
press for utterance, weigh on
my heart, and obscure my sight.</p>

<p>Are we ever to meet again? and will
you endeavour to render that meeting
happier than the last? Will you endeavour
to restrain your caprices, in order
to give vigour to affection, and to give
play to the checked sentiments that
nature intended should expand your
heart? I cannot indeed, without agony,
think of your bosom's being conti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-131" id="Pg_3-131"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-131.png">131</a>]</span>nually
contaminated; and bitter are
the tears which exhaust my eyes, when
I recollect why my child and I are
forced to stray from the asylum, in
which, after so many storms, I had
hoped to rest, smiling at angry fate.&mdash;These
are not common sorrows; nor
can you perhaps conceive, how much
active fortitude it requires to labour
perpetually to blunt the shafts of disappointment.</p>

<p>Examine now yourself, and ascertain
whether you can live in something-like
a settled stile. Let our confidence
in future be unbounded; consider whether
you find it necessary to sacrifice
me to what you term "the zest of life;"
and, when you have once a clear view
of your own motives, of your own incentive
to action, do not deceive me!</p>

<p>The train of thoughts which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-132" id="Pg_3-132"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-132.png">132</a>]</span>
writing of this epistle awoke, makes
me so wretched, that I must take a
walk, to rouse and calm my mind.
But first, let me tell you, that, if you
really wish to promote my happiness,
you will endeavour to give me as much
as you can of yourself. You have great
mental energy; and your judgment
seems to me so just, that it is only the
dupe of your inclination in discussing
one subject.</p>

<p>The post does not go out to-day.
To-morrow I may write more tranquilly.
I cannot yet say when the vessel
will sail in which I have determined
to depart.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right">Saturday Morning.</p>

<p>Your second letter reached me about
an hour ago. You were certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-133" id="Pg_3-133"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-133.png">133</a>]</span>
wrong, in supposing that I did not mention
you with respect; though, without
my being conscious of it, some sparks
of resentment may have animated the
gloom of despair&mdash;Yes; with less affection,
I should have been more respectful.
However the regard which I
have for you, is so unequivocal to myself,
I imagine that it must be sufficiently
obvious to every body else. Besides,
the only letter I intended for the
public eye was to &mdash;&mdash;, and that I destroyed
from delicacy before you saw
them, because it was only written (of
course warmly in your praise) to prevent
any odium being thrown on you<a name="FNanchor_133-A_20" id="FNanchor_133-A_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_133-A_20" class="fnanchor">[133-A]</a>.</p>

efforts, to make the business terminate
to your satisfaction in which I am engaged.</p>

principles of my soul, and the

talks of sailing on Monday; but I am
afraid I shall be detained some days

I am where I cannot expect a letter;

have received great civilities, will send
them after me.</p>

<p>Do write by every occasion! I am
anxious to hear how your affairs go on;
and, still more, to be convinced that you
are not separating yourself from us.
For my little darling is calling papa,
and adding her parrot word&mdash;Come,
Come! And will you not come, and

astonished you.&mdash;The town did not
please me quite so well as formerly&mdash;It
appeared so diminutive; and, when
I found that many of the inhabitants
had lived in the same houses ever since
I left it, I could not help wondering
how they could thus have vegetated,
whilst I was running over a world of
sorrow, snatching at pleasure, and
throwing off prejudices. The place

in business, and your extreme
restlessness of mind.&mdash;Even now I am
almost afraid to ask you, whether the
pleasure of being free, does not over-balance
the pain you felt at parting
with me? Sometimes I indulge the
hope that you will feel me necessary to

written my letter to you intended to
be left at a little village, offered to go
to &mdash;&mdash; to pass to-day. We had a
troublesome sail&mdash;and now I must hurry
on board again, for the wind has
changed.</p>

<p>I half expected to find a letter from
you here. Had you written one haphazard,
it would have been kind and
considerate&mdash;you might have known,
had you thought, that the wind would
not permit me to depart. These are
attentions, more grateful to the heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-152" id="Pg_3-152"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-152.png">152</a>]</span>
than offers of service&mdash;But why do I
foolishly continue to look for them?</p>

<p>Adieu! adieu! My friend&mdash;your
friendship is very cold&mdash;you see I am
hurt.&mdash;God bless you! I may perhaps
be, some time or other, independent in
every sense of the word&mdash;Ah! there
is but one sense of it of consequence.
I will break or bend this weak heart&mdash;yet
even now it is full.</p>

<h4>LETTER LII</h4>

<p class="right">June 27, Saturday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I arrived</span> in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; this afternoon,
after vainly attempting to land
at &mdash;&mdash;. I have now but a moment,
before the post goes out, to inform you
we have got here; though not without
considerable difficulty, for we were set
ashore in a boat above twenty miles
below.</p>

<p>What I suffered in the vessel I will
not now descant upon&mdash;nor mention
the pleasure I received from the sight
of the rocky coast.&mdash;This morning
however, walking to join the carriage
that was to transport us to this place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-154" id="Pg_3-154"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-154.png">154</a>]</span>
I fell, without any previous warning,
senseless on the rocks&mdash;and how I
escaped with life I can scarcely guess.
I was in a stupour for a quarter of an
hour; the suffusion of blood at last restored
me to my senses&mdash;the contusion
is great, and my brain confused. The
child is well.</p>

<p>Twenty miles ride in the rain, after
my accident, has sufficiently deranged
me&mdash;and here I could not get a fire to
warm me, or any thing warm to eat;
the inns are mere stables&mdash;I must nevertheless
go to bed. For God's sake, let
me hear from you immediately, my
friend! I am not well and yet you
see I cannot die.</p>

<h4>LETTER LIII</h4>

<p class="right">June 29.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I wrote</span> to you by the last post, to
inform you of my arrival; and I believe
I alluded to the extreme fatigue I endured
on ship-board, owing to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s
illness, and the roughness of the weather&mdash;I
likewise mentioned to you my
fall, the effects of which I still feel,
though I do not think it will have any
serious consequences.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; will go with me, if I find it
necessary to go to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. The inns
here are so bad, I was forced to accept

overwhelmed with civilities on all sides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-156" id="Pg_3-156"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-156.png">156</a>]</span>
and fatigued with the endeavours to
amuse me, from which I cannot escape.</p>

<p>My friend&mdash;my friend, I am not
well&mdash;a deadly weight of sorrow lies
heavily on my heart. I am again tossed
on the troubled billows of life; and
obliged to cope with difficulties, without
being buoyed up by the hopes that
alone render them bearable. "How flat,
dull, and unprofitable," appears to me
all the bustle into which I see people
here so eagerly enter! I long every
night to go to bed, to hide my melancholy
face in my pillow; but there is
a canker-worm in my bosom that never
sleeps.</p>

<p class="right">July 1.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I labour</span> in vain to calm my mind&mdash;my
soul has been overwhelmed by sorrow
and disappointment. Every thing
fatigues me&mdash;this is a life that cannot
last long. It is you who must determine
with respect to futurity&mdash;and,
when you have, I will act accordingly&mdash;I
mean, we must either resolve to live
together, or part for ever, I cannot
bear these continual struggles&mdash;But I
wish you to examine carefully your own
heart and mind; and, if you perceive
the least chance of being happier without
me than with me, or if your incli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-158" id="Pg_3-158"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-158.png">158</a>]</span>nation
leans capriciously to that side,
do not dissemble; but tell me frankly
that you will never see me more. I
will then adopt the plan I mentioned
to you&mdash;for we must either live together,
or I will be entirely independent.</p>

<p>My heart is so oppressed, I cannot
write with precision&mdash;You know however
that what I so imperfectly express,
are not the crude sentiments of the
moment&mdash;You can only contribute to
my comfort (it is the consolation I am
in need of) by being with me&mdash;and, if
the tenderest friendship is of any value,
why will you not look to me for a degree
of satisfaction that heartless affections
cannot bestow?</p>

meet me at Basle?&mdash;I shall, I should
imagine, be at &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; before the close
of August; and, after you settle your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-159" id="Pg_3-159"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-159.png">159</a>]</span>

<h4>LETTER LV</h4>

<p class="right">July 3.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a gloominess diffused
through your last letter, the impression
of which still rests on my mind&mdash;though,
recollecting how quickly you throw off
the forcible feelings of the moment, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-160" id="Pg_3-160"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-160.png">160</a>]</span>
flatter myself it has long since given
place to your usual cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Believe me (and my eyes fill with
tears of tenderness as I assure you)
there is nothing I would not endure in
the way of privation, rather than disturb
your tranquillity.&mdash;If I am fated
to be unhappy, I will labour to hide
my sorrows in my own bosom; and you
shall always find me a faithful, affectionate
friend.</p>

<p>I grow more and more attached to
my little girl&mdash;and I cherish this affection
without fear, because it must be
a long time before it can become bitterness
of soul.&mdash;She is an interesting
creature.&mdash;On ship-board, how often
as I gazed at the sea, have I longed to
bury my troubled bosom in the less
troubled deep; asserting with Brutus,
"that the virtue I had followed too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-161" id="Pg_3-161"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-161.png">161</a>]</span>
far, was merely an empty name!" and
nothing but the sight of her&mdash;her playful
smiles, which seemed to cling and
twine round my heart&mdash;could have
stopped me.</p>

<p>What peculiar misery has fallen to
my share! To act up to my principles,
I have laid the strictest restraint
on my very thoughts&mdash;yes; not to
sully the delicacy of my feelings, I have
reined in my imagination; and started
with affright from every sensation,
(I allude to &mdash;&mdash;) that stealing with
balmy sweetness into my soul, led me
to scent from afar the fragrance of reviving
nature.</p>

<p>My friend, I have dearly paid for
one conviction.&mdash;Love, in some minds,
is an affair of sentiment, arising from
the same delicacy of perception (or
taste) as renders them alive to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-162" id="Pg_3-162"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-162.png">162</a>]</span>
beauties of nature, poetry, &amp;c., alive
to the charms of those evanescent graces
that are, as it were, impalpable&mdash;they
must be felt, they cannot be described.</p>

<p>Love is a want of my heart. I have
examined myself lately with more care
than formerly, and find, that to deaden
is not to calm the mind&mdash;Aiming at
tranquillity, I have almost destroyed all
the energy of my soul&mdash;almost rooted
out what renders it estimable&mdash;Yes, I
have damped that enthusiasm of character,
which converts the grossest
materials into a fuel, that imperceptibly
feeds hopes, which aspire above
common enjoyment. Despair, since
the birth of my child, has rendered me
stupid&mdash;soul and body seemed to be
fading away before the withering touch
of disappointment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-163" id="Pg_3-163"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-163.png">163</a>]</span>
I am now endeavouring to recover
myself&mdash;and such is the elasticity of my
constitution, and the purity of the atmosphere
here, that health unsought
for, begins to reanimate my countenance.</p>

<p>I have the sincerest esteem and affection
for you&mdash;but the desire of regaining
peace, (do you understand me?)
has made me forget the respect due to
my own emotions&mdash;sacred emotions,
that are the sure harbingers of the delights
I was formed to enjoy&mdash;and
shall enjoy, for nothing can extinguish
the heavenly spark.</p>

<p>Still, when we meet again, I will
not torment you, I promise you. I
blush when I recollect my former conduct&mdash;and
will not in future confound
myself with the beings whom I feel to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-164" id="Pg_3-164"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-164.png">164</a>]</span>
be my inferiors.&mdash;I will listen to delicacy,
or pride.</p>

<h4>LETTER LVI</h4>

<p class="right">July 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I hope</span> to hear from you by to-morrow's
mail. My dearest friend! I cannot
tear my affections from you&mdash;and,
though every remembrance stings me
to the soul, I think of you, till I make
allowance for the very defects of character,
that have given such a cruel stab
to my peace.</p>

<p>Still however I am more alive, than
you have seen me for a long, long time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-165" id="Pg_3-165"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-165.png">165</a>]</span>
I have a degree of vivacity, even in my
grief, which is preferable to the benumbing
stupour that, for the last year,
has frozen up all my faculties.&mdash;Perhaps
this change is more owing to returning
health, than to the vigour of
my reason&mdash;for, in spite of sadness (and
surely I have had my share), the purity
of this air, and the being continually
out in it, for I sleep in the country every
night, has made an alteration in my
appearance that really surprises me.&mdash;The
rosy fingers of health already streak
my cheeks&mdash;and I have seen a <i>physical</i>
life in my eyes, after I have been climbing
the rocks, that resembled the fond,
credulous hopes of youth.</p>

<p>With what a cruel sigh have I recollected
that I had forgotten to hope!&mdash;Reason,
or rather experience, does not
thus cruelly damp poor &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s plea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-166" id="Pg_3-166"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-166.png">166</a>]</span>sures;
she plays all day in the garden
with &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s children, and makes
friends for herself.</p>

<p>Do not tell me, that you are happier
without us&mdash;Will you not come to us in
Switzerland? Ah, why do not you
love us with more sentiment?&mdash;why
are you a creature of such sympathy,
that the warmth of your feelings, or
rather quickness of your senses, hardens
your heart? It is my misfortune,
that my imagination is perpetually
shading your defects, and lending you
charms, whilst the grossness of your
senses makes you (call me not vain)
overlook graces in me, that only dignity
of mind, and the sensibility of an
expanded heart can give.&mdash;God bless
you! Adieu.</p>

<p class="right">July 14.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> now on my journey to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
I felt more at leaving my child, than I
thought I should&mdash;and, whilst at night
I imagined every instant that I heard
the half-formed sounds of her voice,&mdash;I
asked myself how I could think of
parting with her for ever, of leaving
her thus helpless?</p>

<p>Poor lamb! It may run very well
in a tale, that "God will temper the
winds to the shorn lamb!" but how
can I expect that she will be shielded,

brave continually the pitiless storm?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-170" id="Pg_3-170"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-170.png">170</a>]</span>
Yes; I could add, with poor Lear&mdash;What
is the war of elements to the
pangs of disappointed affection, and
the horror arising from a discovery of
a breach of confidence, that snaps every
social tie!</p>

<p>All is not right somewhere!&mdash;When
you first knew me, I was not thus lost.
I could still confide&mdash;for I opened my
heart to you&mdash;of this only comfort you
have deprived me, whilst my happiness,
you tell me, was your first object.
Strange want of judgment!</p>

<p>I will not complain; but, from the
soundness of your understanding, I am
convinced, if you give yourself leave to
reflect, you will also feel, that your
conduct to me, so far from being generous,
has not been just.&mdash;I mean not
to allude to factitious principles of
morality; but to the simple basis of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-171" id="Pg_3-171"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-171.png">171</a>]</span>
rectitude.&mdash;However I did not intend

me, out of tenderness; for
my fainting, or rather convulsion,
when I landed, and my sudden changes
of countenance since, have alarmed
her so much, that she is perpetually
afraid of some accident&mdash;But it would
have injured the child this warm season,
as she is cutting her teeth.</p>

<p>I hear not of your having written to
me at &mdash;&mdash;. Very well! Act as you
please&mdash;there is nothing I fear or care
for! When I see whether I can, or

not a subject of complaint, it has afforded
me pleasure,&mdash;and reflected
pleasure is all I have to hope for&mdash;if a
spark of hope be yet alive in my forlorn
bosom.</p>

<p>I will try to write with a degree of
composure. I wish for us to live together,
because I want you to acquire an
habitual tenderness for my poor girl.
I cannot bear to think of leaving her
alone in the world, or that she should
only be protected by your sense of duty.
Next to preserving her, my most earnest
wish is not to disturb your peace. I
have nothing to expect, and little to
fear, in life&mdash;There are wounds that
can never be healed&mdash;but they may be
allowed to fester in silence without
wincing.</p>

than you give me credit for. I will not
torment you. If I am destined always
to be disappointed and unhappy, I will
conceal the anguish I cannot dissipate;
and the tightened cord of life or reason
will at last snap, and set me free.</p>

<p>Yes; I shall be happy&mdash;This heart is
worthy of the bliss its feelings anticipate&mdash;and
I cannot even persuade myself,
wretched as they have made me,
that my principles and sentiments are
not founded in nature and truth. But

<h4>LETTER LXII</h4>

<p class="right">August 7.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Air</span>, exercise, and bathing, have
restored me to health, braced my muscles,
and covered my ribs, even whilst
I have recovered my former activity.&mdash;I
cannot tell you that my mind is calm,
though I have snatched some moments
of exquisite delight, wandering through
the woods, and resting on the rocks.</p>

<p>This state of suspense, my friend, is
intolerable; we must determine on
something&mdash;and soon;&mdash;we must meet
shortly, or part for ever. I am sensible
that I acted foolishly&mdash;but I was
wretched&mdash;when we were together&mdash;Expecting
too much, I let the pleasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-180" id="Pg_3-180"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-180.png">180</a>]</span>
I might have caught, slip from me. I
cannot live with you&mdash;I ought not&mdash;if
you form another attachment. But I
promise you, mine shall not be intruded
on you. Little reason have I to expect
a shadow of happiness, after the cruel
disappointments that have rent my
heart; but that of my child seems to
depend on our being together. Still I
do not wish you to sacrifice a chance of
enjoyment for an uncertain good. I
feel a conviction, that I can provide
for her, and it shall be my object&mdash;if
we are indeed to part to meet no more.
Her affection must not be divided. She
must be a comfort to me&mdash;if I am to
have no other&mdash;and only know me as
her support.&mdash;I feel that I cannot endure
the anguish of corresponding
with you&mdash;if we are only to correspond.&mdash;No;
if you seek for happi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-181" id="Pg_3-181"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-181.png">181</a>]</span>ness
elsewhere, my letters shall not interrupt
your repose. I will be dead to
you. I cannot express to you what
pain it gives me to write about an eternal
separation.&mdash;You must determine&mdash;examine
yourself&mdash;But, for God's sake!
spare me the anxiety of uncertainty!&mdash;I
may sink under the trial; but I will
not complain.</p>

<p>Adieu! If I had any thing more to
say to you, it is all flown, and absorbed
by the most tormenting apprehensions,
yet I scarcely know what new form of
misery I have to dread.</p>

<p>I ought to beg your pardon for having
sometimes written peevishly; but
you will impute it to affection, if you
understand any thing of the heart of</p>

<h4>LETTER LXIV</h4>

<p class="right">August 26.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I arrived</span> here last night, and with
the most exquisite delight, once more
pressed my babe to my heart. We
shall part no more. You perhaps cannot
conceive the pleasure it gave me, to
see her run about, and play alone. Her
increasing intelligence attaches me more
and more to her. I have promised her that
I will fulfil my duty to her; and nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-184" id="Pg_3-184"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-184.png">184</a>]</span>
in future shall make me forget it. I
will also exert myself to obtain an independence
for her; but I will not be
too anxious on this head.</p>

<p>I have already told you, that I have
recovered my health. Vigour, and
even vivacity of mind, have returned
with a renovated constitution. As for
peace, we will not talk of it. I was
not made, perhaps, to enjoy the calm
contentment so termed.&mdash;</p>

<p>You tell me that my letters torture
you; I will not describe the effect
yours have on me. I received
three this morning, the last dated the
7th of this month. I mean not to give
vent to the emotions they produced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-185" id="Pg_3-185"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-185.png">185</a>]</span>&mdash;Certainly
you are right; our minds are
not congenial. I have lived in an ideal
world, and fostered sentiments that you
do not comprehend&mdash;or you would not
treat me thus. I am not, I will not
be, merely an object of compassion&mdash;a
clog, however light, to teize you. Forget
that I exist: I will never remind
you. Something emphatical whispers
me to put an end to these struggles.
Be free&mdash;I will not torment, when I
cannot please. I can take care of my
child; you need not continually tell me
that our fortune is inseparable, <i>that you
will try to cherish tenderness</i> for me. Do
no violence to yourself! When we are
separated, our interest, since you give
so much weight to pecuniary considerations,
will be entirely divided. I want
not protection without affection; and
support I need not, whilst my faculties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-186" id="Pg_3-186"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-186.png">186</a>]</span>
are undisturbed. I had a dislike to living
in England; but painful feelings
must give way to superior considerations.
I may not be able to acquire
the sum necessary to maintain my child
and self elsewhere. It is too late to go to
Switzerland. I shall not remain at &mdash;&mdash;,
living expensively. But be not alarmed!
I shall not force myself on you any
more.</p>

<p>Adieu! I am agitated&mdash;my whole
frame is convulsed&mdash;my lips tremble,
as if shook by cold, though fire seems to
be circulating in my veins.</p>

<h4>LETTER LXV</h4>

<p class="right">September 6.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I received</span> just now your letter of the
20th. I had written you a letter last
night, into which imperceptibly slipt
some of my bitterness of soul. I will
copy the part relative to business. I
am not sufficiently vain to imagine that
I can, for more than a moment, cloud
your enjoyment of life&mdash;to prevent
even that, you had better never hear
from me&mdash;and repose on the idea that
I am happy.</p>

<p>Gracious God! It is impossible for
me to stifle something like resentment,
when I receive fresh proofs of your in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-188" id="Pg_3-188"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-188.png">188</a>]</span>difference.
What I have suffered this
last year, is not to be forgotten! I
have not that happy substitute for wisdom,
insensibility&mdash;and the lively sympathies
which bind me to my fellow-creatures,
are all of a painful kind.&mdash;They
are the agonies of a broken heart&mdash;pleasure
and I have shaken hands.</p>

<p>I see here nothing but heaps of ruins,
and only converse with people immersed
in trade and sensuality.</p>

<p>I am weary of travelling&mdash;yet seem
to have no home&mdash;no resting place to
look to.&mdash;I am strangely cast off.&mdash;How
often, passing through the rocks, I have
thought, "But for this child, I would
lay my head on one of them, and never
open my eyes again!" With a heart
feelingly alive to all the affections of
my nature&mdash;I have never met with one,
softer than the stone that I would fain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-189" id="Pg_3-189"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-189.png">189</a>]</span>
take for my last pillow. I once thought
I had, but it was all a delusion. I meet
with families continually, who are
bound together by affection or principle&mdash;and,
when I am conscious that I
have fulfilled the duties of my station,
almost to a forgetfulness of myself, I
am ready to demand, in a murmuring
tone, of Heaven, "Why am I thus
abandoned?"</p>

<p>You say now&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<p>I do not understand you. It is necessary
for you to write more explicitly&mdash;and
determine on some mode of conduct.&mdash;I
cannot endure this suspense&mdash;Decide&mdash;Do
you fear to strike another
blow? We live together, or eternally
part!&mdash;I shall not write to you again,

compose my tortured soul, before I

<p>I do not know whether I write intelligibly,
for my head is disturbed.&mdash;But this
you ought to pardon&mdash;for it is with difficulty
frequently that I make out what
you mean to say&mdash;You write, I suppose,
at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s after dinner, when your
head is not the clearest&mdash;and as for your
heart, if you have one, I see nothing
like the dictates of affection, unless a
glimpse when you mention, the child.&mdash;Adieu!</p>

<p class="right">September 25.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just finished a letter, to be
given in charge to captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
In that I complained of your silence,
and expressed my surprise that three
mails should have arrived without
bringing a line for me. Since I
closed it, I hear of another, and still
no letter.&mdash;I am labouring to write
calmly&mdash;this silence is a refinement on
cruelty. Had captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; remained
a few days longer, I would have
returned with him to England. What
have I to do here? I have repeatedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-192" id="Pg_3-192"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-192.png">192</a>]</span>
written to you fully. Do you do the

in suspense. I have not deserved this
of you. I cannot write, my mind is
so distressed. Adieu!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Letters may po&#383;&#383;ibly
be found to contain the fine&#383;t examples
of the language of &#383;entiment and
pa&#383;&#383;ion ever pre&#383;ented to the world.
They bear a &#383;triking re&#383;emblance to
the celebrated romance of Werter,
though the incidents to which they relate
are of a very different ca&#383;t. Probably
the readers to whom Werter
is incapable of affording plea&#383;ure, will
receive no delight from the pre&#383;ent
publication. The editor apprehends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-vii_S" id="Pg_3-vii_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-vii.png">vii</a>]</span>
that, in the judgment of tho&#383;e be&#383;t
qualified to decide upon the compari&#383;on,
the&#383;e Letters will be admitted to
have the &#383;uperiority over the fiction of
Goethe. They are the off&#383;pring of a
glowing imagination, and a heart penetrated
with the pa&#383;&#383;ion it e&#383;&#383;ays to de&#383;cribe.</p>

<p>To the &#383;eries of letters con&#383;tituting
the principal article in the&#383;e two volumes,
are added various pieces, none
of which, it is hoped, will be found
di&#383;creditable to the talents of the author.
The &#383;light fragment of Letters on
the Management of Infants, may be
thought a trifle; but it &#383;eems to have
&#383;ome value, as pre&#383;enting to us with
vividne&#383;s the intention of the writer on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-viii_S" id="Pg_3-viii_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
this important &#383;ubject. The publication
of a few &#383;elect Letters to Mr.
John&#383;on, appeared to be at once a ju&#383;t
monument to the &#383;incerity of his friend&#383;hip,
and a valuable and intere&#383;ting
&#383;pecimen of the mind of the writer.
The Letter on the Pre&#383;ent Character
of the French Nation, the Extract of
the Cave of Fancy, a Tale, and the
Hints for the Second Part of the Rights
of Woman, may, I believe, &#383;afely be
left to &#383;peak for them&#383;elves. The E&#383;&#383;ay
on Poetry and our Reli&#383;h for the Beauties
of Nature, appeared in the Monthly
Magazine for April la&#383;t, and is the
only piece in this collection which has
previou&#383;ly found its way to the pre&#383;s.</p>

when I am ab&#383;ent from tho&#383;e I love, my

had never been gratified by their pre&#383;ence&mdash;I
was going to &#383;ay care&#383;&#383;es&mdash;and
why &#383;hould I not? I have found out
that I have more mind than you, in one
re&#383;pect; becau&#383;e I can, without any
violent effort of rea&#383;on, find food for
love in the &#383;ame object, much longer

of the few ro&#383;es that afford them

you go.&mdash;This joke wears the &#383;allow
ca&#383;t of thought; for, though I began to
write cheerfully, &#383;ome melancholy tears
have found their way into my eyes, that
linger there, whil&#383;t a glow of tenderne&#383;s

dignity your character, not to talk of
my own, demands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I have been, you tell me, three
days without writing, I ought not to
complain of two: yet, as I expected to
receive a letter this afternoon, I am
hurt; and why &#383;hould I, by concealing
it, affect the heroi&#383;m I do not feel?</p>

<p>I hate commerce. How differently
mu&#383;t &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s head and heart be organized
from mine! You will tell me,
that exertions are nece&#383;&#383;ary: I am
weary of them! The face of things,
public and private, vexes me. The
"peace" and clemency which &#383;eemed
to be dawning a few days ago, di&#383;appear
again. "I am fallen," as Milton &#383;aid,
"on evil days;" for I really believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-25_S" id="Pg_3-25_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-25.png">25</a>]</span>
that Europe will be in a &#383;tate of convul&#383;ion,
during half a century at lea&#383;t.
Life is but a labour of patience: it is
always rolling a great &#383;tone up a hill;
for, before a per&#383;on can find a re&#383;ting-place,
imagining it is lodged, down it
comes again, and all the work is to be
done over anew!</p>

<p>Should I attempt to write any more,
I could not change the &#383;train. My head
aches, and my heart is heavy. The
world appears an "unweeded garden,"
where "things rank and vile" flouri&#383;h
be&#383;t.</p>

<p>If you do not return &#383;oon&mdash;or, which
is no &#383;uch mighty matter, talk of it&mdash;I

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> ju&#383;t received your kind and
rational letter, and would fain hide my
face, glowing with &#383;hame for my folly.&mdash;I
would hide it in your bo&#383;om, if you
would again open it to me, and ne&#383;tle
clo&#383;ely till you bade my fluttering
heart be &#383;till, by &#383;aying that you forgave

tears, and in the humble&#383;t attitude, I
intreat you.&mdash;Do not turn from me, for
indeed I love you fondly, and have been
very wretched, &#383;ince the night I was &#383;o
cruelly hurt by thinking that you had
no confidence in me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is time for me to grow more rea&#383;onable,

in fact, been very much indi&#383;po&#383;ed for
a few days pa&#383;t, and the notion that I
was tormenting, or perhaps killing, a
poor little animal, about whom I am
grown anxious and tender, now I feel
it alive, made me wor&#383;e. My bowels
have been dreadfully di&#383;ordered, and
every thing I ate or drank di&#383;agreed
with my &#383;tomach; &#383;till I feel intimations
of its exi&#383;tence, though they have been
fainter.</p>

<p>Do you think that the creature goes
regularly to &#383;leep? I am ready to a&#383;k as
many que&#383;tions as Voltaire's Man of
Forty Crowns. Ah! do not continue to
be angry with me! You perceive that I
am already &#383;miling through my tears&mdash;You
have lightened my heart, and my
frozen &#383;pirits are melting into playfulne&#383;s.</p>

I &#383;hall count the minutes. But drop
not an angry word&mdash;I cannot now bear
it. Yet, if you think I de&#383;erve a &#383;colding
(it does not admit of a que&#383;tion, I

fine pro&#383;pect, and that it will rather
enliven, than &#383;atiate my imagination.</p>

<p>I have called on Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. She
has the manners of a gentlewoman,
with a da&#383;h of the ea&#383;y French coquetry,
which renders her <i>piquante</i>.&mdash;But <i>Mon&#383;ieur</i>
her hu&#383;band, whom nature never
dreamed of ca&#383;ting in either the mould
of a gentleman or lover, makes but an
aukward figure in the foreground of
the picture.</p>

<p>The H&mdash;&mdash;s are very ugly, without
doubt&mdash;and the hou&#383;e &#383;melt of commerce
from top to toe&mdash;&#383;o that his
abortive attempt to di&#383;play ta&#383;te, only
proved it to be one of the things not to
be bought with gold. I was in a room
a moment alone, and my attention was
attracted by the <i>pendule</i>&mdash;A nymph was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-49_S" id="Pg_3-49_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-49.png">49</a>]</span>
offering up her vows before a &#383;moking
altar, to a fat-bottomed Cupid (&#383;aving
your pre&#383;ence), who was kicking his
heels in the air.&mdash;Ah! kick on, thought
I; for the demon of traffic will ever
fright away the loves and graces, that
&#383;treak with the ro&#383;y beams of infant
fancy the <i>&#383;ombre</i> day of life&mdash;whil&#383;t the
imagination, not allowing us to &#383;ee
things as they are, enables us to catch
a ha&#383;ty draught of the running &#383;tream
of delight, the thir&#383;t for which &#383;eems to
be given only to tantalize us.</p>

<p>But I am philo&#383;ophizing; nay, perhaps
you will call me &#383;evere, and bid
me let the &#383;quare-headed money-getters
alone.&mdash;Peace to them! though none
of the &#383;ocial &#383;prites (and there are not a
few of different de&#383;criptions, who &#383;port
about the various inlets to my heart)
gave me a twitch to re&#383;train my pen.</p>

<p>I write in a hurry, becau&#383;e the little

when I am &#383;ad, I lament that all my

all afford me &#383;natches of exqui&#383;ite enjoyment&mdash;This

&#383;he has got into my heart

without her, her little figure is ever
dancing before me.</p>

<p>You too have &#383;omehow clung round

not however &#383;uppo&#383;e that I am melancholy&mdash;for,
when you are from me,
I not only wonder how I can find fault
with you&mdash;but how I can doubt your
affection.</p>

of the &#383;en&#383;es, pa&#383;&#383;ions, if you will,
and the conclu&#383;ions of rea&#383;on, draw
men together; but the imagination is
the true fire, &#383;tolen from heaven, to
animate this cold creature of clay, producing
all tho&#383;e fine &#383;ympathies that

my packet of letters. He called on me
before; and I like him better than I
did&mdash;that is, I have the &#383;ame opinion
of his under&#383;tanding, but I think with
you, he has more tenderne&#383;s and real
delicacy of feeling with re&#383;pect to women,
than are commonly to be met with.
His manner too of &#383;peaking of his little
girl, about the age of mine, intere&#383;ted
me. I gave him a letter for my &#383;i&#383;ter,
and reque&#383;ted him to &#383;ee her.</p>

<p>I have been interrupted. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
I &#383;uppo&#383;e will write about bu&#383;ine&#383;s.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-64_S" id="Pg_3-64_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-64.png">64</a>]</span>
Public affairs I do not de&#383;cant on, except
to tell you that they write now
with great freedom and truth, and this
liberty of the pre&#383;s will overthrow the
Jacobins, I plainly perceive.</p>

<p>I hope you take care of your health.
I have got a habit of re&#383;tle&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s at
night, which ari&#383;es, I believe, from
activity of mind; for, when I am alone,
that is, not near one to whom I can
open my heart, I &#383;ink into reveries and
trains of thinking, which agitate and
fatigue me.</p>

<p>This is my third letter; when am I
to hear from you? I need not tell you,
I &#383;uppo&#383;e, that I am now writing with
&#383;omebody in the room with me, and
&mdash;&mdash; is waiting to carry this to Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s. I will then ki&#383;s the girl for
you, and bid you adieu.</p>

letters, to bring back to me your barrier-face&mdash;or
that you &#383;hould not be
loved by my barrier-girl. I know that
you will love her more and more, for
&#383;he is a little affectionate, intelligent
creature, with as much vivacity, I
&#383;hould think, as you could wi&#383;h for.</p>

<p>I was going to tell you of two or
three things which di&#383;plea&#383;e me here;
but they are not of &#383;ufficient con&#383;equence
to interrupt plea&#383;ing &#383;en&#383;ations.
I have received a letter from
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. I want you to bring &mdash;&mdash;

<p class="right">October 1.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a heartle&#383;s ta&#383;k to write letters,
without knowing whether they will
ever reach you.&mdash;I have given two to
&mdash;&mdash;, who has been a-going, a-going,

others, which were written in a low-&#383;pirited

opportunities that were mentioned to
me. <i>Tant mieux!</i> you will &#383;ay, and I
will not &#383;ay nay; for I &#383;hould be &#383;orry
that the contents of a letter, when you

I ju&#383;t now &#383;tumbled on one of the kind
letters, which you wrote during your
la&#383;t ab&#383;ence. You are then a dear
affectionate creature, and I will not
plague you. The letter which you
chance to receive, when the ab&#383;ence is
&#383;o long, ought to bring only tears of
tenderne&#383;s, without any bitter alloy,
into your eyes.</p>

<p>After your return I hope indeed,
that you will not be &#383;o immer&#383;ed in
bu&#383;ine&#383;s, as during the la&#383;t three or
four months pa&#383;t&mdash;for even money, taking
into the account all the future comforts
it is to procure, may be gained at
too dear a rate, if painful impre&#383;&#383;ions
are left on the mind.&mdash;The&#383;e impre&#383;&#383;ions
were much more lively, &#383;oon after
you went away, than at pre&#383;ent&mdash;for a

melancholy traces they left on my mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-71_S" id="Pg_3-71_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-71.png">71</a>]</span>&mdash;and
every emotion is on the &#383;ame &#383;ide
as my rea&#383;on, which always was on
yours.&mdash;Separated, it would be almo&#383;t
impious to dwell on real or imaginary
imperfections of character.&mdash;I feel that
I love you; and, if I cannot be happy

<p>I have been interrupted&mdash;and mu&#383;t

about his children; but his indi&#383;criminate

given him an inveterate habit of drinking,
that de&#383;troys his health, as well as

This intercour&#383;e with the world, which
obliges one to &#383;ee the wor&#383;t &#383;ide of

content with the object you had fir&#383;t in

my part; and, even here, &#383;ufficient to

to obtain. And, let me tell you,
I have my project al&#383;o&mdash;and, if you do
not &#383;oon return, the little girl and I
will take care of our&#383;elves; we will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-85_S" id="Pg_3-85_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-85.png">85</a>]</span>

even by her attention.&mdash;However &#383;he
has an affectionate hu&#383;band in her turn,
to render her care light, and to &#383;hare
her plea&#383;ure.</p>

<p>I will own to you that, feeling extreme

grow &#383;ad very often when I am playing

you, in &#383;earch of what we may

I only take advantage of every occa&#383;ion,

ought to receive the &#383;ultan, whenever
he deigns to return, with open arms,
though his have been polluted by half
an hundred promi&#383;cuous amours during
his ab&#383;ence.</p>

<p>I con&#383;ider fidelity and con&#383;tancy as
two di&#383;tinct things; yet the former is
nece&#383;&#383;ary, to give life to the other&mdash;and
&#383;uch a degree of re&#383;pect do I think
due to my&#383;elf, that, if only probity,
which is a good thing in its place,
brings you back, never return!&mdash;for,
if a wandering of the heart, or even a
caprice of the imagination detains
you&mdash;there is an end of all my hopes of
happine&#383;s&mdash;I could not forgive it, if I
would.</p>

<p>I have gotten into a melancholy

that it is the rare&#383;t thing in the world,

When I am thus &#383;ad, I lament that my

ha&#383;ty <i>notes</i>; for bu&#383;ine&#383;s &#383;o entirely occupies

which are drawing you into a gulph,
that, if it do not ab&#383;orb your happine&#383;s,
will infallibly de&#383;troy mine.</p>

<p>Fatigued during my youth by the
mo&#383;t arduous &#383;truggles, not only to obtain
independence, but to render my&#383;elf
u&#383;eful, not merely plea&#383;ure, for
which I had the mo&#383;t lively ta&#383;te, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-93_S" id="Pg_3-93_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-93.png">93</a>]</span>

pa&#383;&#383;ion and affection, e&#383;caped me, but
the mo&#383;t melancholy views of life were
impre&#383;&#383;ed by a di&#383;appointed heart on
my mind. Since I knew you, I have
been endeavouring to go back to my
former nature, and have allowed &#383;ome
time to glide away, winged with the
delight which only &#383;pontaneous enjoyment
can give.&mdash;Why have you &#383;o
&#383;oon di&#383;&#383;olved the charm?</p>

<p>I am really unable to bear the continual
inquietude which your and
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s never-ending plans produce.
This you may term want of firmne&#383;s&mdash;but
you are mi&#383;taken&mdash;I have &#383;till &#383;ufficient
firmne&#383;s to pur&#383;ue my principle
of action. The pre&#383;ent mi&#383;ery, I cannot
find a &#383;ofter word to do ju&#383;tice to

therefore I have not firmne&#383;s
to &#383;upport it as you may think I
ought. I &#383;hould have been content,
and &#383;till wi&#383;h, to retire with you to a
farm&mdash;My God! any thing, but the&#383;e
continual anxieties&mdash;any thing but
commerce, which deba&#383;es the mind,
and roots out affection from the heart.</p>

<p>I do not mean to complain of &#383;ubordinate
inconveniences&mdash;&mdash;yet I will
&#383;imply ob&#383;erve, that, led to expect
you every week, I did not make the
arrangements required by the pre&#383;ent
circum&#383;tances, to procure the nece&#383;&#383;aries
of life. In order to have them,
a &#383;ervant, for that purpo&#383;e only, is indi&#383;pen&#383;ible&mdash;The
want of wood, has made
me catch the mo&#383;t violent cold I ever
had; and my head is &#383;o di&#383;turbed by
continual coughing, that I am unable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-95_S" id="Pg_3-95_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-95.png">95</a>]</span>
to write without &#383;topping frequently to
recollect my&#383;elf.&mdash;This however is one
of the common evils which mu&#383;t be
borne with&mdash;&mdash;bodily pain does not
touch the heart, though it fatigues the
&#383;pirits.</p>

<p>Still as you talk of your return, even
in February, doubtingly, I have determined,
the moment the weather
changes, to wean my child.&mdash;It is too
&#383;oon for her to begin to divide &#383;orrow!&mdash;And
as one has well &#383;aid, "de&#383;pair is a
freeman," we will go and &#383;eek our fortune
together.</p>

<p>This is not a caprice of the moment&mdash;for
your ab&#383;ence has given new
weight to &#383;ome conclu&#383;ions, that I was
very reluctantly forming before you
left me.&mdash;I do not chu&#383;e to be a &#383;econdary

the core, cautioned me about &#383;uckling
my child too long.&mdash;God pre&#383;erve this
poor child, and render her happier
than her mother!</p>

<p>But I am wandering from my &#383;ubject:
indeed my head turns giddy, when I
think that all the confidence I have had
in the affection of others is come to this.</p>

<p>I did not expect this blow from you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-103_S" id="Pg_3-103_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-103.png">103</a>]</span>
I have done my duty to you and my
child; and if I am not to have any
return of affection to reward me, I
have the &#383;ad con&#383;olation of knowing
that I de&#383;erved a better fate. My
&#383;oul is weary&mdash;I am &#383;ick at heart; and,
but for this little darling, I would
cea&#383;e to care about a life, which is now
&#383;tripped of every charm.</p>

declamation, when I meant &#383;imply to
tell you, that I con&#383;ider your reque&#383;ting
me to come to you, as merely dictated
by honour.&mdash;Indeed, I &#383;carcely under&#383;tand
you.&mdash;You reque&#383;t me to come,
and then tell me, that you have not
given up all thoughts of returning to
this place.</p>

<p>When I determined to live with you,
I was only governed by affection.&mdash;I
would &#383;hare poverty with you, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-104_S" id="Pg_3-104_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-104.png">104</a>]</span>

on which you are entering.&mdash;I have
certain principles of action: I know
what I look for to found my happine&#383;s
on.&mdash;It is not money.&mdash;With you I
wi&#383;hed for &#383;ufficient to procure the
comforts of life&mdash;as it is, le&#383;s will
do.&mdash;I can &#383;till exert my&#383;elf to
obtain the nece&#383;&#383;aries of life for my
child, and &#383;he does not want more at
pre&#383;ent.&mdash;I have two or three plans in
my head to earn our &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence; for
do not &#383;uppo&#383;e that, neglected by you,
I will lie under obligations of a pecuniary
kind to you!&mdash;No; I would &#383;ooner
&#383;ubmit to menial &#383;ervice.&mdash;I wanted the
&#383;upport of your affection&mdash;that gone,
all is over!&mdash;I did not think, when I
complained of &mdash;&mdash;'s contemptible avidity
to accumulate money, that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-105_S" id="Pg_3-105_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-105.png">105</a>]</span>
would have dragged you into his
&#383;chemes.</p>

<p>I cannot write.&mdash;I inclo&#383;e a fragment
of a letter, written &#383;oon after your
departure, and another which tenderne&#383;s
made me keep back when it was
written.&mdash;You will &#383;ee then the &#383;entiments
of a calmer, though not a more
determined, moment.&mdash;Do not in&#383;ult
me by &#383;aying, that "our being together
is paramount to every other con&#383;ideration!"
Were it, you would not be
running after a bubble, at the expence
of my peace of mind.</p>

ever receive from me.</p>

<h4>LETTER XXXVI</h4>

<p class="right">Feb. 10.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> talk of "permanent views and
future comfort"&mdash;not for me, for I am
dead to hope. The inquietudes of the
la&#383;t winter have fini&#383;hed the bu&#383;ine&#383;s,
and my heart is not only broken, but
my con&#383;titution de&#383;troyed. I conceive
my&#383;elf in a galloping con&#383;umption, and
the continual anxiety I feel at the
thought of leaving my child, feeds the
fever that nightly devours me. It is
on her account that I again write to
you, to conjure you, by all that you
hold &#383;acred, to leave her here with the
German lady you may have heard me
mention! She has a child of the &#383;ame
age, and they may be brought up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-107_S" id="Pg_3-107_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-107.png">107</a>]</span>gether,
as I wi&#383;h her to be brought up.
I &#383;hall write more fully on the &#383;ubject.
To facilitate this, I &#383;hall give up my
pre&#383;ent lodgings, and go into the &#383;ame
hou&#383;e. I can live much cheaper there,
which is now become an object. I have
had 3000 livres from &mdash;&mdash;, and I &#383;hall
take one more, to pay my &#383;ervant's
wages, &amp;c. and then I &#383;hall endeavour
to procure what I want by my own exertions.
I &#383;hall entirely give up the acquaintance
of the Americans.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; and I have not been on good
terms a long time. Ye&#383;terday he very
unmanlily exulted over me, on account
of your determination to &#383;tay. I had
provoked it, it is true, by &#383;ome a&#383;perities
again&#383;t commerce, which have
dropped from me, when we have argued
about the propriety of your remaining
where you are; and it is no matter, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-108_S" id="Pg_3-108_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-108.png">108</a>]</span>
have drunk too deep of the bitter cup
to care about trifles.</p>

<p>When you fir&#383;t entered into the&#383;e
plans, you bounded your views to the
gaining of a thou&#383;and pounds. It was
&#383;ufficient to have procured a farm in
America, which would have been an
independence. You find now that you
did not know your&#383;elf, and that a certain
&#383;ituation in life is more nece&#383;&#383;ary
to you than you imagined&mdash;more nece&#383;&#383;ary
than an uncorrupted heart&mdash;For
a year or two, you may procure your&#383;elf
what you call plea&#383;ure; eating,
drinking, and women; but, in the &#383;olitude
of declining life, I &#383;hall be remembered
with regret&mdash;I was going to
&#383;ay with remor&#383;e, but checked my
pen.</p>

<p>As I have never concealed the nature of
my connection with you, your repu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-109_S" id="Pg_3-109_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-109.png">109</a>]</span>tation
will not &#383;uffer. I &#383;hall never have
a confident: I am content with the approbation
of my own mind; and, if there
be a &#383;earcher of hearts, mine will not
be de&#383;pi&#383;ed. Reading what you have
written relative to the de&#383;ertion of women,
I have often wondered how theory
and practice could be &#383;o different, till
I recollected, that the &#383;entiments of
pa&#383;&#383;ion, and the re&#383;olves of rea&#383;on, are
very di&#383;tinct. As to my &#383;i&#383;ters, as you
are &#383;o continually hurried with bu&#383;ine&#383;s,
you need not write to them&mdash;I
&#383;hall, when my mind is calmer. God
ble&#383;s you! Adieu!</p>

<p class="right">* * * *</p>

<p>This has been &#383;uch a period of barbarity
and mi&#383;ery, I ought not to complain
of having my &#383;hare. I wi&#383;h one
moment that I had never heard of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-110_S" id="Pg_3-110_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-110.png">110</a>]</span>
cruelties that have been practi&#383;ed here,
and the next envy the mothers who
have been killed with their children.
Surely I had &#383;uffered enough in life,
not to be cur&#383;ed with a fondne&#383;s, that
burns up the vital &#383;tream I am imparting.
You will think me mad: I
would I were &#383;o, that I could forget
my mi&#383;ery&mdash;&#383;o that my head or heart
would be &#383;till.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">Feb. 19.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I fir&#383;t received your letter,
putting off your return to an indefinite
time, I felt &#383;o hurt, that I know not
what I wrote. I am now calmer,
though it was not the kind of wound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-111_S" id="Pg_3-111_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-111.png">111</a>]</span>
over which time has the quicke&#383;t effect;
on the contrary, the more I think, the
&#383;adder I grow. Society fatigues me inexpre&#383;&#383;ibly&mdash;So
much &#383;o, that finding

enough, to di&#383;cover that the fault is

me, and, but for her, I &#383;hould not take
any pains to recover my health.</p>

<p>As it is, I &#383;hall wean her, and try if
by that &#383;tep (to which I feel a repugnance,
for it is my only &#383;olace) I can
get rid of my cough. Phy&#383;icians talk
much of the danger attending any complaint
on the lungs, after a woman has
&#383;uckled for &#383;ome months. They lay a
&#383;tre&#383;s al&#383;o on the nece&#383;&#383;ity of keeping
the mind tranquil&mdash;and, my God! how
has mine been harra&#383;&#383;ed! But whil&#383;t
the caprices of other women are gratified,

to vi&#383;it them too rudely," I have not
found a guardian angel, in heaven or
on earth, to ward off &#383;orrow or care
from my bo&#383;om.</p>

<p>What &#383;acrifices have you not made
for a woman you did not re&#383;pect!&mdash;But
I will not go over this ground&mdash;I want
to tell you that I do not under&#383;tand
you. You &#383;ay that you have not given
up all thoughts of returning here&mdash;and
I know that it will be nece&#383;&#383;ary&mdash;nay,
is. I cannot explain my&#383;elf; but if you
have not lo&#383;t your memory, you will
ea&#383;ily divine my meaning. What! is
our life then only to be made up of &#383;eparations?
and am I only to return to
a country, that has not merely lo&#383;t all
charms for me, but for which I feel a
repugnance that almo&#383;t amounts to
horror, only to be left there a prey to
it!</p>

would be freer. Indeed, expecting you
to join us, I had formed &#383;ome plans
of u&#383;efulne&#383;s that have now vani&#383;hed
with my hopes of happine&#383;s.</p>

<p>In the bitterne&#383;s of my heart, I could

here dependent on a man, who&#383;e avidity
to acquire a fortune has rendered
him callous to every &#383;entiment connected

a brutal in&#383;en&#383;ibility, he
cannot help di&#383;playing the plea&#383;ure
your determination to &#383;tay gives him,
in &#383;pite of the effect it is vi&#383;ible it has
had on me.</p>

<p>Till I can earn money, I &#383;hall endeavour

<h4>LETTER XLIV</h4>

<p class="right">Friday, June 12.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> ju&#383;t received yours dated the
9th, which I &#383;uppo&#383;e was a mi&#383;take, for
it could &#383;carcely have loitered &#383;o long
on the road. The general ob&#383;ervations
which apply to the &#383;tate of your own
mind, appear to me ju&#383;t, as far as they
go; and I &#383;hall always con&#383;ider it as
one of the mo&#383;t &#383;erious mi&#383;fortunes of
my life, that I did not meet you, before
&#383;atiety had rendered your &#383;en&#383;es &#383;o fa&#383;tidious,
as almo&#383;t to clo&#383;e up every tender
avenue of &#383;entiment and affection
that leads to your &#383;ympathetic heart.
You have a heart, my friend, yet, hurried
away by the impetuo&#383;ity of inferior
feelings, you have &#383;ought in vulgar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-128_S" id="Pg_3-128_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-128.png">128</a>]</span>
exce&#383;&#383;es, for that gratification which
only the heart can be&#383;tow.</p>

<p>The common run of men, I know,
with &#383;trong health and gro&#383;s appetites,
mu&#383;t have variety to bani&#383;h <i>ennui</i>, becau&#383;e
the imagination never lends its
magic wand, to convert appetite into
love, cemented by according rea&#383;on.&mdash;Ah!
my friend, you know not the ineffable
delight, the exqui&#383;ite plea&#383;ure,
which ari&#383;es from a uni&#383;on of affection
and de&#383;ire, when the whole &#383;oul and
&#383;en&#383;es are abandoned to a lively imagination,
that renders every emotion delicate
and rapturous. Yes; the&#383;e are
emotions, over which &#383;atiety has no
power, and the recollection of which,
even di&#383;appointment cannot di&#383;enchant;
but they do not exi&#383;t without &#383;elf-denial.
The&#383;e emotions, more or le&#383;s
&#383;trong, appear to me to be the di&#383;tinc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-129_S" id="Pg_3-129_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-129.png">129</a>]</span>tive
characteri&#383;tic of genius, the foundation
of ta&#383;te, and of that exqui&#383;ite
reli&#383;h for the beauties of nature, of
which the common herd of eaters and
drinkers and <i>child-begeters</i>, certainly
have no idea. You will &#383;mile at an
ob&#383;ervation that has ju&#383;t occurred to me:&mdash;I
con&#383;ider tho&#383;e minds as the mo&#383;t
&#383;trong and original, who&#383;e imagination
acts as the &#383;timulus to their &#383;en&#383;es.</p>

<p>Well! you will a&#383;k, what is the re&#383;ult
of all this rea&#383;oning? Why I cannot
help thinking that it is po&#383;&#383;ible for
you, having great &#383;trength of mind,
to return to nature, and regain a &#383;anity
of con&#383;titution, and purity of feeling&mdash;which
would open your heart to me.&mdash;I
would fain re&#383;t there!</p>

<p>Yet, convinced more than ever of
the &#383;incerity and tenderne&#383;s of my attachment
to you, the involuntary hopes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-130_S" id="Pg_3-130_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-130.png">130</a>]</span>
which a determination to live has revived,
are not &#383;ufficiently &#383;trong to di&#383;&#383;ipate
the cloud, that de&#383;pair has &#383;pread
over futurity. I have looked at the
&#383;ea, and at my child, hardly daring to
own to my&#383;elf the &#383;ecret wi&#383;h, that it
might become our tomb; and that the
heart, &#383;till &#383;o alive to angui&#383;h, might
there be quieted by death. At this
moment ten thou&#383;and complicated &#383;entiments
pre&#383;s for utterance, weigh on
my heart, and ob&#383;cure my &#383;ight.</p>

<p>Are we ever to meet again? and will
you endeavour to render that meeting
happier than the la&#383;t? Will you endeavour
to re&#383;train your caprices, in order
to give vigour to affection, and to give
play to the checked &#383;entiments that
nature intended &#383;hould expand your
heart? I cannot indeed, without agony,
think of your bo&#383;om's being conti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-131_S" id="Pg_3-131_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-131.png">131</a>]</span>nually
contaminated; and bitter are
the tears which exhau&#383;t my eyes, when
I recollect why my child and I are
forced to &#383;tray from the a&#383;ylum, in
which, after &#383;o many &#383;torms, I had
hoped to re&#383;t, &#383;miling at angry fate.&mdash;The&#383;e
are not common &#383;orrows; nor
can you perhaps conceive, how much
active fortitude it requires to labour
perpetually to blunt the &#383;hafts of di&#383;appointment.</p>

<p>Examine now your&#383;elf, and a&#383;certain
whether you can live in &#383;omething-like
a &#383;ettled &#383;tile. Let our confidence
in future be unbounded; con&#383;ider whether
you find it nece&#383;&#383;ary to &#383;acrifice
me to what you term "the ze&#383;t of life;"
and, when you have once a clear view
of your own motives, of your own incentive
to action, do not deceive me!</p>

<p>The train of thoughts which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-132_S" id="Pg_3-132_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-132.png">132</a>]</span>
writing of this epi&#383;tle awoke, makes
me &#383;o wretched, that I mu&#383;t take a
walk, to rou&#383;e and calm my mind.
But fir&#383;t, let me tell you, that, if you
really wi&#383;h to promote my happine&#383;s,
you will endeavour to give me as much
as you can of your&#383;elf. You have great
mental energy; and your judgment
&#383;eems to me &#383;o ju&#383;t, that it is only the
dupe of your inclination in di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing
one &#383;ubject.</p>

<p>The po&#383;t does not go out to-day.
To-morrow I may write more tranquilly.
I cannot yet &#383;ay when the ve&#383;&#383;el
will &#383;ail in which I have determined

dwell on this &#383;ubject.&mdash;Will you not
endeavour to cheri&#383;h all the affection
you can for me? What am I &#383;aying?&mdash;Rather

which converts the gro&#383;&#383;e&#383;t
materials into a fuel, that imperceptibly
feeds hopes, which a&#383;pire above
common enjoyment. De&#383;pair, &#383;ince

I have a degree of vivacity, even in my
grief, which is preferable to the benumbing
&#383;tupour that, for the la&#383;t year,
has frozen up all my faculties.&mdash;Perhaps
this change is more owing to returning

my rea&#383;on&mdash;for, in &#383;pite of &#383;adne&#383;s (and
&#383;urely I have had my &#383;hare), the purity
of this air, and the being continually

<p>Do not tell me, that you are happier

Switzerland? Ah, why do not you
love us with more &#383;entiment?&mdash;why
are you a creature of &#383;uch &#383;ympathy,
that the warmth of your feelings, or
rather quickne&#383;s of your &#383;en&#383;es, hardens
your heart? It is my mi&#383;fortune,
that my imagination is perpetually
&#383;hading your defects, and lending you
charms, whil&#383;t the gro&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s of your

is the war of elements to the

a breach of confidence, that &#383;naps every

<p>All is not right &#383;omewhere!&mdash;When

Strange want of judgment!</p>

<p>I will not complain; but, from the

convinced, if you give your&#383;elf leave to

not made, perhaps, to enjoy the calm
contentment &#383;o termed.&mdash;</p>

<p class="sp">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p class="sp">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>You tell me that my letters torture
you; I will not de&#383;cribe the effect
yours have on me. I received
three this morning, the la&#383;t dated the
7th of this month. I mean not to give
vent to the emotions they produced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-185_S" id="Pg_3-185_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-185.png">185</a>]</span>&mdash;Certainly
you are right; our minds are
not congenial. I have lived in an ideal
world, and fo&#383;tered &#383;entiments that you
do not comprehend&mdash;or you would not
treat me thus. I am not, I will not
be, merely an object of compa&#383;&#383;ion&mdash;a
clog, however light, to teize you. Forget
that I exi&#383;t: I will never remind
you. Something emphatical whi&#383;pers
me to put an end to the&#383;e &#383;truggles.
Be free&mdash;I will not torment, when I
cannot plea&#383;e. I can take care of my
child; you need not continually tell me
that our fortune is in&#383;eparable, <i>that you
will try to cheri&#383;h tenderne&#383;s</i> for me. Do
no violence to your&#383;elf! When we are
&#383;eparated, our intere&#383;t, &#383;ince you give
&#383;o much weight to pecuniary con&#383;iderations,
will be entirely divided. I want
not protection without affection; and
&#383;upport I need not, whil&#383;t my faculties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-186_S" id="Pg_3-186_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-186.png">186</a>]</span>
are undi&#383;turbed. I had a di&#383;like to living
in England; but painful feelings
mu&#383;t give way to &#383;uperior con&#383;iderations.
I may not be able to acquire
the &#383;um nece&#383;&#383;ary to maintain my child
and &#383;elf el&#383;ewhere. It is too late to go to
Switzerland. I &#383;hall not remain at &mdash;&mdash;,
living expen&#383;ively. But be not alarmed!
I &#383;hall not force my&#383;elf on you any
more.</p>

<p>Adieu! I am agitated&mdash;my whole
frame is convul&#383;ed&mdash;my lips tremble,
as if &#383;hook by cold, though fire &#383;eems to
be circulating in my veins.</p>

<p>God ble&#383;s you.</p>

<h4>LETTER LXV</h4>

<p class="right">September 6.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I received</span> ju&#383;t now your letter of the
20th. I had written you a letter la&#383;t
night, into which imperceptibly &#383;lipt
&#383;ome of my bitterne&#383;s of &#383;oul. I will
copy the part relative to bu&#383;ine&#383;s. I
am not &#383;ufficiently vain to imagine that
I can, for more than a moment, cloud
your enjoyment of life&mdash;to prevent
even that, you had better never hear
from me&mdash;and repo&#383;e on the idea that
I am happy.</p>

<p>Gracious God! It is impo&#383;&#383;ible for
me to &#383;tifle &#383;omething like re&#383;entment,
when I receive fre&#383;h proofs of your in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-188_S" id="Pg_3-188_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-188.png">188</a>]</span>difference.
What I have &#383;uffered this
la&#383;t year, is not to be forgotten! I
have not that happy &#383;ub&#383;titute for wi&#383;dom,
in&#383;en&#383;ibility&mdash;and the lively &#383;ympathies
which bind me to my fellow-creatures,
are all of a painful kind.&mdash;They
are the agonies of a broken heart&mdash;plea&#383;ure
and I have &#383;haken hands.</p>

<p>I &#383;ee here nothing but heaps of ruins,
and only conver&#383;e with people immer&#383;ed
in trade and &#383;en&#383;uality.</p>

<p>I am weary of travelling&mdash;yet &#383;eem
to have no home&mdash;no re&#383;ting place to
look to.&mdash;I am &#383;trangely ca&#383;t off.&mdash;How
often, pa&#383;&#383;ing through the rocks, I have
thought, "But for this child, I would
lay my head on one of them, and never
open my eyes again!" With a heart
feelingly alive to all the affections of
my nature&mdash;I have never met with one,
&#383;ofter than the &#383;tone that I would fain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-189_S" id="Pg_3-189_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-189.png">189</a>]</span>
take for my la&#383;t pillow. I once thought
I had, but it was all a delu&#383;ion. I meet
with families continually, who are
bound together by affection or principle&mdash;and,
when I am con&#383;cious that I
have fulfilled the duties of my &#383;tation,
almo&#383;t to a forgetfulne&#383;s of my&#383;elf, I
am ready to demand, in a murmuring
tone, of Heaven, "Why am I thus
abandoned?"</p>

<p>You &#383;ay now&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<p class="sp">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>
<p class="sp">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>I do not under&#383;tand you. It is nece&#383;&#383;ary
for you to write more explicitly&mdash;and
determine on &#383;ome mode of conduct.&mdash;I
cannot endure this &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e&mdash;Decide&mdash;Do
you fear to &#383;trike another
blow? We live together, or eternally
part!&mdash;I &#383;hall not write to you again,
till I receive an an&#383;wer to this. I mu&#383;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-190_S" id="Pg_3-190_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-190.png">190</a>]</span>
compo&#383;e my tortured &#383;oul, before I
write on indifferent &#383;ubjects.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<p class="sp">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>
<p class="sp">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>I do not know whether I write intelligibly,
for my head is di&#383;turbed.&mdash;But this
you ought to pardon&mdash;for it is with difficulty
frequently that I make out what
you mean to &#383;ay&mdash;You write, I &#383;uppo&#383;e,
at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s after dinner, when your
head is not the cleare&#383;t&mdash;and as for your
heart, if you have one, I &#383;ee nothing
like the dictates of affection, unle&#383;s a
glimp&#383;e when you mention, the child.&mdash;Adieu!</p>

<h4>LETTER LXVI</h4>

<p class="right">September 25.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> ju&#383;t fini&#383;hed a letter, to be
given in charge to captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
In that I complained of your &#383;ilence,
and expre&#383;&#383;ed my &#383;urpri&#383;e that three
mails &#383;hould have arrived without
bringing a line for me. Since I
clo&#383;ed it, I hear of another, and &#383;till
no letter.&mdash;I am labouring to write
calmly&mdash;this &#383;ilence is a refinement on
cruelty. Had captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; remained
a few days longer, I would have
returned with him to England. What
have I to do here? I have repeatedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3-192_S" id="Pg_3-192_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v3-192.png">192</a>]</span>
written to you fully. Do you do the
&#383;ame&mdash;and quickly. Do not leave me
in &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e. I have not de&#383;erved this
of you. I cannot write, my mind is
&#383;o di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed. Adieu!</p>
