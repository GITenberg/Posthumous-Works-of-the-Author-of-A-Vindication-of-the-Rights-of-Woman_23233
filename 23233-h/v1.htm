<h2><a name="V1_PREFACE" id="V1_PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> public are here presented with
the last literary attempt of an author,
whose fame has been uncommonly extensive,
and whose talents have probably
been most admired, by the persons
by whom talents are estimated
with the greatest accuracy and discrimination.
There are few, to whom
her writings could in any case have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-viii" id="Pg_1-viii"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
given pleasure, that would have wished
that this fragment should have been
suppressed, because it is a fragment.
There is a sentiment, very dear to minds
of taste and imagination, that finds a
melancholy delight in contemplating
these unfinished productions of genius,
these sketches of what, if they had
been filled up in a manner adequate to
the writer's conception, would perhaps
have given a new impulse to the
manners of a world.</p>

<p>The purpose and structure of the
following work, had long formed a
favourite subject of meditation with
its author, and she judged them capable
of producing an important effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-ix" id="Pg_1-ix"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-ix.png">ix</a>]</span>
The composition had been in progress
for a period of twelve months. She
was anxious to do justice to her conception,
and recommenced and revised
the manuscript several different times.
So much of it as is here given to the
public, she was far from considering
as finished, and, in a letter to a friend
directly written on this subject, she
says, "I am perfectly aware that some of
the incidents ought to be transposed,
and heightened by more harmonious
shading; and I wished in some degree
to avail myself of criticism, before I
began to adjust my events into a story,
the outline of which I had sketched in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-x" id="Pg_1-x"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-x.png">x</a>]</span>
my mind<a name="FNanchor_X-A_1" id="FNanchor_X-A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_X-A_1" class="fnanchor">[x-A]</a>." The only friends to whom
the author communicated her manuscript,
were Mr. Dyson, the translator
of the Sorcerer, and the present editor;
and it was impossible for the most inexperienced
author to display a stronger
desire of profiting by the censures and
sentiments that might be suggested<a name="FNanchor_X-B_2" id="FNanchor_X-B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_X-B_2" class="fnanchor">[x-B]</a>.</p>

<p>In revising these sheets for the press,
it was necessary for the editor, in some
places, to connect the more finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xi" id="Pg_1-xi"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xi.png">xi</a>]</span>
parts with the pages of an older copy,
and a line or two in addition sometimes
appeared requisite for that purpose.
Wherever such a liberty has been
taken, the additional phrases will be
found inclosed in brackets; it being
the editor's most earnest desire, to
intrude nothing of himself into the
work, but to give to the public the
words, as well as ideas, of the real
author.</p>

<p>What follows in the ensuing pages,
is not a preface regularly drawn out
by the author, but merely hints for a
preface, which, though never filled up
in the manner the writer intended,
appeared to be worth preserving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Wrongs of Woman, like the
wrongs of the oppressed part of mankind,
may be deemed necessary by
their oppressors: but surely there are
a few, who will dare to advance before
the improvement of the age, and
grant that my sketches are not the
abortion of a distempered fancy, or
the strong delineations of a wounded
heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xiv" id="Pg_1-xiv"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xiv.png">xiv</a>]</span>In writing this novel, I have rather
endeavoured to pourtray passions than
manners.</p>

<p>In many instances I could have made
the incidents more dramatic, would I
have sacrificed my main object, the
desire of exhibiting the misery and
oppression, peculiar to women, that
arise out of the partial laws and customs
of society.</p>

<p>In the invention of the story, this
view restrained my fancy; and the
history ought rather to be considered,
as of woman, than of an individual.</p>

<p>The sentiments I have embodied.</p>

<p>In many works of this species, the
hero is allowed to be mortal, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xv" id="Pg_1-xv"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xv.png">xv</a>]</span>
become wise and virtuous as well as
happy, by a train of events and circumstances.
The heroines, on the
contrary, are to be born immaculate;
and to act like goddesses of wisdom, just
come forth highly finished Minervas
from the head of Jove.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>[The following is an extract of a
letter from the author to a friend, to
whom she communicated her manuscript.]</p>

<hr />

<p>For my part, I cannot suppose any
situation more distressing, than for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xvi" id="Pg_1-xvi"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xvi.png">xvi</a>]</span>
woman of sensibility, with an improving
mind, to be bound to such a man
as I have described for life; obliged
to renounce all the humanizing affections,
and to avoid cultivating her
taste, lest her perception of grace and
refinement of sentiment, should sharpen
to agony the pangs of disappointment.
Love, in which the imagination
mingles its bewitching colouring,
must be fostered by delicacy. I should
despise, or rather call her an ordinary
woman, who could endure such a husband
as I have sketched.</p>

<p>These appear to me (matrimonial
despotism of heart and conduct) to be
the peculiar Wrongs of Woman, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xvii" id="Pg_1-xvii"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xvii.png">xvii</a>]</span>cause
they degrade the mind. What
are termed great misfortunes, may
more forcibly impress the mind of common
readers; they have more of what
may justly be termed <i>stage-effect</i>; but
it is the delineation of finer sensations,
which, in my opinion, constitutes the
merit of our best novels. This is what
I have in view; and to show the
wrongs of different classes of women,
equally oppressive, though, from the
difference of education, necessarily
various.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abodes</span> of horror have frequently
been described, and castles, filled with
spectres and chimeras, conjured up by
the magic spell of genius to harrow the
soul, and absorb the wondering mind.
But, formed of such stuff as dreams are
made of, what were they to the mansion
of despair, in one corner of which
Maria sat, endeavouring to recal her
scattered thoughts!</p>

<p>Surprise, astonishment, that bordered
on distraction, seemed to have suspend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-2" id="Pg_1-2"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-2.png">2</a>]</span>ed
her faculties, till, waking by degrees
to a keen sense of anguish, a
whirlwind of rage and indignation
roused her torpid pulse. One recollection
with frightful velocity following
another, threatened to fire her brain,
and make her a fit companion for the
terrific inhabitants, whose groans and
shrieks were no unsubstantial sounds of
whistling winds, or startled birds, modulated
by a romantic fancy, which
amuse while they affright; but such
tones of misery as carry a dreadful certainty
directly to the heart. What
effect must they then have produced on
one, true to the touch of sympathy, and
tortured by maternal apprehension<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.!'">!</ins></p>

<p>Her infant's image was continually
floating on Maria's sight, and the first
smile of intelligence remembered, as
none but a mother, an unhappy mo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-3" id="Pg_1-3"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-3.png">3</a>]</span>ther,
can conceive. She heard her half
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads 'speaking half'">speaking</ins> cooing, and felt the little
twinkling fingers on her burning bosom&mdash;a
bosom bursting with the nutriment
for which this cherished child
might now be pining in vain. From
a stranger she could indeed receive the
maternal aliment, Maria was grieved
at the thought&mdash;but who would watch
her with a mother's tenderness, a mother's
self-denial?</p>

<p>The retreating shadows of former
sorrows rushed back in a gloomy train,
and seemed to be pictured on the walls
of her prison, magnified by the state
of mind in which they were viewed&mdash;Still
she mourned for her child, lamented
she was a daughter, and anticipated
the aggravated ills of life that her sex
rendered almost inevitable, even while
dreading she was no more. To think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-4" id="Pg_1-4"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-4.png">4</a>]</span>
that she was blotted out of existence
was agony, when the imagination had
been long employed to expand her
faculties; yet to suppose her turned
adrift on an unknown sea, was scarcely
less afflicting.</p>

<p>After being two days the prey of impetuous,
varying emotions, Maria began
to reflect more calmly on her present
situation, for she had actually been rendered
incapable of sober reflection, by
the discovery of the act of atrocity of
which she was the victim. She could
not have imagined, that, in all the fermentation
of civilized depravity, a similar
plot could have entered a human
mind. She had been stunned by an unexpected
blow; yet life, however joyless,
was not to be indolently resigned,
or misery endured without exertion,
and proudly termed patience. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-5" id="Pg_1-5"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-5.png">5</a>]</span>
had hitherto meditated only to point
the dart of anguish, and suppressed
the heart heavings of indignant nature
merely by the force of contempt. Now
she endeavoured to brace her mind to
fortitude, and to ask herself what was
to be her employment in her dreary
cell? Was it not to effect her escape,
to fly to the succour of her child, and
to baffle the selfish schemes of her tyrant&mdash;her
husband?</p>

<p>These thoughts roused her sleeping
spirit, and the self-possession returned,
that seemed to have abandoned her in
the infernal solitude into which she
had been precipitated. The first emotions
of overwhelming impatience began
to subside, and resentment gave
place to tenderness, and more tranquil
meditation; though anger once more
stopt the calm current of reflection<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.'">,</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-6" id="Pg_1-6"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-6.png">6</a>]</span>
when she attempted to move her manacled
arms. But this was an outrage
that could only excite momentary feelings
of scorn, which evaporated in a
faint smile; for Maria was far from
thinking a personal insult the most difficult
to endure with magnanimous indifference.</p>

<p>She approached the small grated
window of her chamber, and for a
considerable time only regarded the
blue expanse; though it commanded
a view of a desolate garden, and of
part of a huge pile of buildings, that,
after having been suffered, for half a
century, to fall to decay, had undergone
some clumsy repairs, merely to
render it habitable. The ivy had been
torn off the turrets, and the stones not
wanted to patch up the breaches of
time, and exclude the warring ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-7" id="Pg_1-7"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-7.png">7</a>]</span>ments,
left in heaps in the disordered
court. Maria contemplated this scene
she knew not how long; or rather
gazed on the walls, and pondered on
her situation. To the master of this
most horrid of prisons, she had, soon
after her entrance, raved of injustice,
in accents that would have justified
his treatment, had not a malignant
smile, when she appealed to his judgment,
with a dreadful conviction stifled
her remonstrating complaints. By
force, or openly, what could be done?
But surely some expedient might occur
to an active mind, without any other
employment, and possessed of sufficient
resolution to put the risk of life into
the balance with the chance of freedom.</p>

<p>A woman entered in the midst of
these reflections, with a firm, deliberate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-8" id="Pg_1-8"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-8.png">8</a>]</span>
step, strongly marked features, and
large black eyes, which she fixed
steadily on Maria's, as if she designed
to intimidate her, saying at the same
time&mdash;"You had better sit down and
eat your dinner, than look at the
clouds."</p>

<p>"I have no appetite," replied Maria,
who had previously determined to
speak mildly, "why then should I
eat?"</p>

<p>"But, in spite of that, you must
and shall eat something. I have had
many ladies under my care, who have
resolved to starve themselves; but, soon
or late, they gave up their intent, as
they recovered their senses."</p>

<p>"Do you really think me mad?"
asked Maria, meeting the searching
glance of her eye.</p>

<p>"Not just now. But what does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-9" id="Pg_1-9"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-9.png">9</a>]</span>
that prove?&mdash;only that you must be
the more carefully watched, for appearing
at times so reasonable. You
have not touched a morsel since you
entered the house."&mdash;Maria sighed intelligibly.&mdash;"Could
any thing but madness
produce such a disgust for food?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grief; you would not ask
the question if you knew what it
was." The attendant shook her head;
and a ghastly smile of desperate fortitude
served as a forcible reply, and
made Maria pause, before she added&mdash;"Yet
I will take some refreshment:
I mean not to die.&mdash;No; I will preserve
my senses; and convince even
you, sooner than you are aware of,
that my intellects have never been disturbed,
though the exertion of them
may have been suspended by some infernal
drug."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-10" id="Pg_1-10"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-10.png">10</a>]</span>
Doubt gathered still thicker on the
brow of her guard, as she attempted
to convict her of mistake.</p>

<p>"Have patience!" exclaimed Maria,
with a solemnity that inspired awe.
"My God! how have I been schooled
into the practice!" A suffocation of
voice betrayed the agonizing emotions
she was labouring to keep down; and
conquering a qualm of disgust, she
calmly endeavoured to eat enough to
prove her docility, perpetually turning
to the suspicious female, whose observation
she courted, while she was
making the bed and adjusting the
room.</p>

<p>"Come to me often," said Maria,
with a tone of persuasion, in consequence
of a vague plan that she had
hastily adopted, when, after surveying
this woman's form and features, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-11" id="Pg_1-11"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-11.png">11</a>]</span>
felt convinced that she had an understanding
above the common standard;
"and believe me mad, till you are
obliged to acknowledge the contrary."
The woman was no fool, that is, she
was superior to her class; nor had
misery quite petrified the life's-blood
of humanity, to which reflections on
our own misfortunes only give a more
orderly course. The manner, rather
than the expostulations, of Maria
made a slight suspicion dart into her
mind with corresponding sympathy,
which various other avocations, and
the habit of banishing compunction,
prevented her, for the present, from
examining more minutely.</p>

<p>But when she was told that no person,
excepting the physician appointed by
her family, was to be permitted to see
the lady at the end of the gallery, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-12" id="Pg_1-12"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-12.png">12</a>]</span>
opened her keen eyes still wider, and
uttered a&mdash;"hem!" before she enquired&mdash;"Why?"
She was briefly told, in
reply, that the malady was hereditary,
and the fits not occurring but at very
long and irregular intervals, she must
be carefully watched; for the length of
these lucid periods only rendered her
more mischievous, when any vexation
or caprice brought on the paroxysm of
phrensy.</p>

<p>Had her master trusted her, it is
probable that neither pity nor curiosity
would have made her swerve from the
straight line of her interest; for she
had suffered too much in her intercourse
with mankind, not to determine
to look for support, rather to humouring
their passions, than courting
their approbation by the integrity of
her conduct. A deadly blight had met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-13" id="Pg_1-13"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-13.png">13</a>]</span>
her at the very threshold of existence;
and the wretchedness of her mother
seemed a heavy weight fastened on her
innocent neck, to drag her down to
perdition. She could not heroically
determine to succour an unfortunate;
but, offended at the bare supposition
that she could be deceived with the
same ease as a common servant, she
no longer curbed her curiosity; and,
though she never seriously fathomed
her own intentions, she would sit, every
moment she could steal from observation,
listening to the tale, which Maria
was eager to relate with all the persuasive
eloquence of grief.</p>

<p>It is so cheering to see a human
face, even if little of the divinity of
virtue beam in it, that Maria anxiously
expected the return of the attendant,
as of a gleam of light to break the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-14" id="Pg_1-14"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-14.png">14</a>]</span>
gloom of idleness. Indulged sorrow;
she perceived, must blunt or sharpen
the faculties to the two opposite extremes;
producing stupidity, the moping
melancholy of indolence; or the
restless activity of a disturbed imagination.
She sunk into one state, after
being fatigued by the other: till the
want of occupation became even more
painful than the actual pressure or apprehension
of sorrow; and the confinement
that froze her into a nook of
existence, with an unvaried prospect
before her, the most insupportable of
evils. The lamp of life seemed to be
spending itself to chase the vapours of
a dungeon which no art could dissipate.&mdash;And
to what purpose did she
rally all her energy?&mdash;Was not the
world a vast prison, and women born
slaves?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-15" id="Pg_1-15"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-15.png">15</a>]</span>
Though she failed immediately to
rouse a lively sense of injustice in the
mind of her guard, because it had
been sophisticated into misanthropy,
she touched her heart. Jemima (she
had only a claim to a Christian name,
which had not procured her any Christian
privileges) could patiently hear of
Maria's confinement on false pretences;
she had felt the crushing hand of
power, hardened by the exercise of
injustice, and ceased to wonder at the
perversions of the understanding, which
systematize oppression; but, when told
that her child, only four months old,
had been torn from her, even while
she was discharging the tenderest maternal
office, the woman awoke in a
bosom long estranged from feminine
emotions, and Jemima determined to
alleviate all in her power, without ha<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-16" id="Pg_1-16"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-16.png">16</a>]</span>zarding
the loss of her place, the sufferings
of a wretched mother, apparently
injured, and certainly unhappy.
A sense of right seems to result from
the simplest act of reason, and to preside
over the faculties of the mind,
like the master-sense of feeling, to
rectify the rest; but (for the comparison
may be carried still farther) how
often is the exquisite sensibility of
both weakened or destroyed by the
vulgar occupations, and ignoble pleasures
of life?</p>

<p>The preserving her situation was,
indeed, an important object to Jemima,
who had been hunted from hole
to hole, as if she had been a beast of
prey, or infected with a moral plague.
The wages she received, the greater
part of which she hoarded, as her only
chance for independence, were much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-17" id="Pg_1-17"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-17.png">17</a>]</span>
more considerable than she could reckon
on obtaining any where else, were
it possible that she, an outcast from
society, could be permitted to earn a
subsistence in a reputable family. Hearing
Maria perpetually complain of listlessness,
and the not being able to beguile
grief by resuming her customary
pursuits, she was easily prevailed on,
by compassion, and that involuntary
respect for abilities, which those who
possess them can never eradicate, to
bring her some books and implements
for writing. Maria's conversation had
amused and interested her, and the natural
consequence was a desire, scarcely
observed by herself, of obtaining the
esteem of a person she admired. The
remembrance of better days was rendered
more lively; and the sentiments
then acquired appearing less romantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-18" id="Pg_1-18"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-18.png">18</a>]</span>
than they had for a long period, a
spark of hope roused her mind to new
activity.</p>

<p>How grateful was her attention to
Maria! Oppressed by a dead weight
of existence, or preyed on by the
gnawing worm of discontent, with
what eagerness did she endeavour to
shorten the long days, which left no
traces behind! She seemed to be
sailing on the vast ocean of life, without
seeing any land-mark to indicate
the progress of time; to find employment
was then to find variety, the
animating principle of nature.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Earnestly</span> as Maria endeavoured
to soothe, by reading, the anguish
of her wounded mind, her thoughts
would often wander from the subject
she was led to discuss, and tears of
maternal tenderness obscured the reasoning
page. She descanted on "the
ills which flesh is heir to," with bitterness,
when the recollection of her
babe was revived by a tale of fictitious
woe, that bore any resemblance to her
own; and her imagination was continually
employed, to conjure up and
embody the various phantoms of misery,
which folly and vice had let loose
on the world. The loss of her babe
was the tender string; against other
cruel remembrances she laboured to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-20" id="Pg_1-20"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-20.png">20</a>]</span>
steel her bosom; and even a ray of
hope, in the midst of her gloomy reveries,
would sometimes gleam on the
dark horizon of futurity, while persuading
herself that she ought to cease
to hope, since happiness was no where
to be found.&mdash;But of her child, debilitated
by the grief with which its
mother had been assailed before it saw
the light, she could not think without
an impatient struggle.</p>

<p>"I, alone, by my active tenderness,
could have saved," she would exclaim,
"from an early blight, this sweet
blossom; and, cherishing it, I should
have had something still to love."</p>

<p>In proportion as other expectations
were torn from her, this tender one
had been fondly clung to, and knit
into her heart.</p>

<p>The books she had obtained, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-21" id="Pg_1-21"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-21.png">21</a>]</span>
soon devoured, by one who had no
other resource to escape from sorrow,
and the feverish dreams of ideal wretchedness
or felicity, which equally weaken
the intoxicated sensibility. Writing
was then the only alternative, and
she wrote some rhapsodies descriptive
of the state of her mind; but the
events of her past life pressing on her,
she resolved circumstantially to relate
them, with the sentiments that experience,
and more matured reason,
would naturally suggest. They might
perhaps instruct her daughter, and
shield her from the misery, the tyranny,
her mother knew not how to avoid.</p>

<p>This thought gave life to her diction,
her soul flowed into it, and she soon
found the task of recollecting almost
obliterated impressions very interesting.
She lived again in the revived emo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-22" id="Pg_1-22"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-22.png">22</a>]</span>tions
of youth, and forgot her present
in the retrospect of sorrows that had
assumed an unalterable character.</p>

<p>Though this employment lightened
the weight of time, yet, never losing
sight of her main object, Maria did
not allow any opportunity to slip of
winning on the affections of Jemima;
for she discovered in her a strength of
mind, that excited her esteem, clouded
as it was by the misanthropy of despair.</p>

<p>An insulated being, from the misfortune
of her birth, she despised and
preyed on the society by which she
had been oppressed, and loved not her
fellow-creatures, because she had never
been beloved. No mother had ever
fondled her, no father or brother had
protected her from outrage; and the
man who had plunged her into in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-23" id="Pg_1-23"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-23.png">23</a>]</span>famy,
and deserted her when she stood
in greatest need of support, deigned
not to smooth with kindness the road
to ruin. Thus degraded, was she let
loose on the world; and virtue, never
nurtured by affection, assumed the stern
aspect of selfish independence.</p>

<p>This general view of her life, Maria
gathered from her exclamations and
dry remarks. Jemima indeed displayed
a strange mixture of interest
and suspicion; for she would listen to
her with earnestness, and then suddenly
interrupt the conversation, as if
afraid of resigning, by giving way to
her sympathy, her dear-bought knowledge
of the world.</p>

<p>Maria alluded to the possibility of
an escape, and mentioned a compensation,
or reward; but the style in which
she was repulsed made her cautious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-24" id="Pg_1-24"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-24.png">24</a>]</span>
and determine not to renew the subject,
till she knew more of the character
she had to work on. Jemima's
countenance, and dark hints, seemed
to say, "You are an extraordinary
woman; but let me consider, this may
only be one of your lucid intervals."
Nay, the very energy of Maria's character,
made her suspect that the extraordinary
animation she perceived
might be the effect of madness. "Should
her husband then substantiate his
charge, and get possession of her estate,
from whence would come the promised
annuity, or more desired protection?
Besides, might not a woman, anxious
to escape, conceal some of the circumstances
which made against her? Was
truth to be expected from one who
had been entrapped, kidnapped, in
the most fraudulent manner?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-25" id="Pg_1-25"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-25.png">25</a>]</span>
In this train Jemima continued to
argue, the moment after compassion
and respect seemed to make her swerve;
and she still resolved not to be wrought
on to do more than soften the rigour
of confinement, till she could advance
on surer ground.</p>

<p>Maria was not permitted to walk in
the garden; but sometimes, from her
window, she turned her eyes from the
gloomy walls, in which she pined life
away, on the poor wretches who strayed
along the walks, and contemplated
the most terrific of ruins&mdash;that of a
human soul. What is the view of the
fallen column, the mouldering arch, of
the most exquisite workmanship, when
compared with this living memento of
the fragility, the instability, of reason,
and the wild luxuriancy of noxious
passions? Enthusiasm turned adrift,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-26" id="Pg_1-26"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-26.png">26</a>]</span>
like some rich stream overflowing its
banks, rushes forward with destructive
velocity, inspiring a sublime concentration
of thought. Thus thought
Maria&mdash;These are the ravages over
which humanity must ever mournfully
ponder, with a degree of anguish not
excited by crumbling marble, or cankering
brass, unfaithful to the trust of
monumental fame. It is not over the
decaying productions of the mind, embodied
with the happiest art, we grieve
most bitterly. The view of what has
been done by man, produces a melancholy,
yet aggrandizing, sense of what
remains to be achieved by human intellect;
but a mental convulsion, which,
like the devastation of an earthquake,
throws all the elements of thought and
imagination into confusion, makes con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-27" id="Pg_1-27"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-27.png">27</a>]</span>templation
giddy, and we fearfully ask
on what ground we ourselves stand.</p>

<p>Melancholy and imbecility marked
the features of the wretches allowed to
breathe at large; for the frantic, those
who in a strong imagination had lost a
sense of woe, were closely confined.
The playful tricks and mischievous devices
of their disturbed fancy, that suddenly
broke out, could not be guarded
against, when they were permitted to
enjoy any portion of freedom; for,
so active was their imagination, that
every new object which accidentally
struck their senses, awoke to phrenzy
their restless passions; as Maria learned
from the burden of their incessant
ravings.</p>

<p>Sometimes, with a strict injunction
of silence, Jemima would allow Maria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-28" id="Pg_1-28"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-28.png">28</a>]</span>
at the close of evening, to stray along
the narrow avenues that separated the
dungeon-like apartments, leaning on
her arm. What a change of scene!
Maria wished to pass the threshold of
her prison, yet, when by chance she
met the eye of rage glaring on her, yet
unfaithful to its office, she shrunk back
with more horror and affright, than if
she had stumbled over a mangled corpse.
Her busy fancy pictured the misery of a
fond heart, watching over a friend thus
estranged, absent, though present&mdash;over
a poor wretch lost to reason and the
social joys of existence; and losing all
consciousness of misery in its excess.
What a task, to watch the light of reason
quivering in the eye, or with agonizing
expectation to catch the beam of recollection;
tantalized by hope, only to
feel despair more keenly, at finding a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-29" id="Pg_1-29"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-29.png">29</a>]</span>
much loved face or voice, suddenly remembered,
or pathetically implored,
only to be immediately forgotten, or
viewed with indifference or abhorrence!</p>

<p>The heart-rending sigh of melancholy
sunk into her soul; and when she retired
to rest, the petrified figures she
had encountered, the only human forms
she was doomed to observe, haunting
her dreams with tales of mysterious
wrongs, made her wish to sleep to dream
no more.</p>

<p>Day after day rolled away, and tedious
as the present moment appeared,
they passed in such an unvaried tenor,
Maria was surprised to find that she
had already been six weeks buried alive,
and yet had such faint hopes of effecting
her enlargement. She was, earnestly
as she had sought for employment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-30" id="Pg_1-30"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-30.png">30</a>]</span>
now angry with herself for having been
amused by writing her narrative; and
grieved to think that she had for an instant
thought of any thing, but contriving
to escape.</p>

<p>Jemima had evidently pleasure in
her society: still, though she often left
her with a glow of kindness, she returned
with the same chilling air; and,
when her heart appeared for a moment
to open, some suggestion of reason forcibly
closed it, before she could give
utterance to the confidence Maria's
conversation inspired.</p>

<p>Discouraged by these changes, Maria
relapsed into despondency, when she
was cheered by the alacrity with which
Jemima brought her a fresh parcel of
books; assuring her, that she had taken
some pains to obtain them from one of
the keepers, who attended a gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-31" id="Pg_1-31"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-31.png">31</a>]</span>man
confined in the opposite corner of
the gallery.</p>

<p>Maria took up the books with emotion.
"They come," said she, "perhaps,
from a wretch condemned, like
me, to reason on the nature of madness,
by having wrecked minds continually
under his eye; and almost to wish himself&mdash;as
I do&mdash;mad, to escape from the
contemplation of it." Her heart throbbed
with sympathetic alarm; and she
turned over the leaves with awe, as if
they had become sacred from passing
through the hands of an unfortunate
being, oppressed by a similar fate.</p>

<p>Dryden's Fables, Milton's Paradise
Lost, with several modern productions,
composed the collection. It was a
mine of treasure. Some marginal notes,
in Dryden's Fables, caught her attention:
they were written with force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-32" id="Pg_1-32"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-32.png">32</a>]</span>
and taste; and, in one of the modern
pamphlets, there was a fragment left,
containing various observations on the
present state of society and government,
with a comparative view of the
politics of Europe and America. These
remarks were written with a degree of
generous warmth, when alluding to the
enslaved state of the labouring majority,
perfectly in unison with Maria's mode
of thinking.</p>

<p>She read them over and over again;
and fancy, treacherous fancy, began to
sketch a character, congenial with her
own, from these shadowy outlines.&mdash;"Was
he mad?" She re-perused the
marginal notes, and they seemed the
production of an animated, but not of a
disturbed imagination. Confined to
this speculation, every time she re-read
them, some fresh refinement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-33" id="Pg_1-33"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-33.png">33</a>]</span>
sentiment, or <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'accuteness'">acuteness</ins> of thought
impressed her, which she was astonished
at herself for not having before observed.</p>

<p>What a creative power has an affectionate
heart! There are beings who
cannot live without loving, as poets
love; and who feel the electric spark
of genius, wherever it awakens sentiment
or grace. Maria had often thought,
when disciplining her wayward heart,
"that to charm, was to be virtuous."
"They who make me wish to appear
the most amiable and good in their eyes,
must possess in a degree," she would
exclaim, "the graces and virtues they
call into action."</p>

<p>She took up a book on the powers of
the human mind; but, her attention
strayed from cold arguments on the
nature of what she felt, while she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-34" id="Pg_1-34"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-34.png">34</a>]</span>
feeling, and she snapt the chain of the
theory to read Dryden's Guiscard and
Sigismunda.</p>

<p>Maria, in the course of the ensuing
day, returned some of the books, with
the hope of getting others&mdash;and more
marginal notes. Thus shut out from
human intercourse, and compelled to
view nothing but the prison of vexed
spirits, to meet a wretch in the same
situation, was more surely to find a
friend, than to imagine a countryman
one, in a strange land, where the human
voice conveys no information to
the eager ear.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the unfortunate
being to whom these books belong?"
asked Maria, when Jemima brought
her supper. "Yes. He sometimes
walks out, between five and six, before
the family is stirring, in the morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-35" id="Pg_1-35"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-35.png">35</a>]</span>
with two keepers; but even then his
hands are confined."</p>

<p>"What! is he so unruly?" enquired
Maria, with an accent of disappointment.</p>

<p>"No, not that I perceive," replied
Jemima; "but he has an untamed
look, a vehemence of eye, that excites
apprehension. Were his hands free,
he looks as if he could soon manage
both his guards: yet he appears
tranquil."</p>

<p>"If he be so strong, he must be
young," observed Maria.</p>

<p>"Three or four and thirty, I suppose;
but there is no judging of a
person in his situation."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that he is mad?"
interrupted Maria with eagerness. Jemima
quitted the room, without replying.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-36" id="Pg_1-36"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-36.png">36</a>]</span>
"No, no, he certainly is not!" exclaimed
Maria, answering herself;
"the man who could write those observations
was not disordered in his
intellects."</p>

<p>She sat musing, gazing at the moon,
and watching its motion as it seemed
to glide under the clouds. Then, preparing
for bed, she thought, "Of
what use could I be to him, or he to
me, if it be true that he is unjustly
confined?&mdash;Could he aid me to escape,
who is himself more closely watched?&mdash;Still
I should like to see him." She
went to bed, dreamed of her child,
yet woke exactly at half after five
o'clock, and starting up, only wrapped
a gown around her, and ran to the
window. The morning was chill, it
was the latter end of September; yet
she did not retire to warm herself and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-37" id="Pg_1-37"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-37.png">37</a>]</span>
think in bed, till the sound of the
servants, moving about the house, convinced
her that the unknown would
not walk in the garden that morning.
She was ashamed at feeling disappointed;
and began to reflect, as an excuse
to herself, on the little objects which
attract attention when there is nothing
to divert the mind; and how difficult
it was for women to avoid growing
romantic, who have no active duties
or pursuits.</p>

<p>At breakfast, Jemima enquired whether
she understood French? for, unless
she did, the stranger's stock of
books was exhausted. Maria replied
in the affirmative; but forbore to ask
any more questions respecting the person
to whom they belonged. And Jemima
gave her a new subject for contemplation,
by describing the person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-38" id="Pg_1-38"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-38.png">38</a>]</span>
of a lovely maniac, just brought into
an adjoining chamber. She was singing
the pathetic ballad of old Rob &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
with the most heart-melting
falls and pauses. Jemima had half-opened
the door, when she distinguished
her voice, and Maria stood close to it,
scarcely daring to respire, lest a modulation
should escape her, so exquisitely
sweet, so passionately wild. She
began with sympathy to pourtray to
herself another victim, when the lovely
warbler flew, as it were, from the
spray, and a torrent of unconnected
exclamations and questions burst from
her, interrupted by fits of laughter, so
horrid, that Maria shut the door, and,
turning her eyes up to heaven, exclaimed&mdash;"Gracious
God!"</p>

<p>Several minutes elapsed before Maria
could enquire respecting the ru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-39" id="Pg_1-39"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-39.png">39</a>]</span>mour
of the house (for this poor
wretch was obviously not confined
without a cause); and then Jemima
could only tell her, that it was said,
"she had been married, against her
inclination, to a rich old man, extremely
jealous (no wonder, for she
was a charming creature); and that,
in consequence of his treatment, or
something which hung on her mind,
she had, during her first lying-in, lost
her senses."</p>

<p>What a subject of meditation&mdash;even
to the very confines of madness.</p>

<p>"Woman, fragile flower! why
were you suffered to adorn a world
exposed to the inroad of such stormy
elements?" thought Maria, while the
poor maniac's strain was still breathing
on her ear, and sinking into her very
soul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-40" id="Pg_1-40"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-40.png">40</a>]</span>
Towards the evening, Jemima brought
her Rousseau's <i>Helo&iuml;se</i>; and she sat
reading with eyes and heart, till the
return of her guard to extinguish the
light. One instance of her kindness
was, the permitting Maria to have
one, till her own hour of retiring to
rest. She had read this work long
since; but now it seemed to open a
new world to her&mdash;the only one worth
inhabiting. Sleep was not to be
wooed; yet, far from being fatigued
by the restless rotation of thought, she
rose and opened her window, just as
the thin watery clouds of twilight
made the long silent shadows visible.
The air swept across her face with a
voluptuous freshness that thrilled to
her heart, awakening indefinable emotions;
and the sound of a waving
branch, or the twittering of a startled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-41" id="Pg_1-41"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-41.png">41</a>]</span>
bird, alone broke the stillness of reposing
nature. Absorbed by the sublime
sensibility which renders the consciousness
of existence felicity, Maria
was happy, till an autumnal scent,
wafted by the breeze of morn from
the fallen leaves of the adjacent wood,
made her recollect that the season had
changed since her confinement; yet
life afforded no variety to solace an
afflicted heart. She returned dispirited
to her couch, and thought of her child
till the broad glare of day again invited
her to the window. She looked
not for the unknown, still how great
was her vexation at perceiving the
back of a man, certainly he, with his
two attendants, as he turned into a
side-path which led to the house! A
confused recollection of having seen
somebody who resembled him, imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-42" id="Pg_1-42"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-42.png">42</a>]</span>diately
occurred, to puzzle and torment
her with endless conjectures. Five
minutes sooner, and she should have
seen his face, and been out of suspense&mdash;was
ever any thing so unlucky!
His steady, bold step, and the whole
air of his person, bursting as it were
from a cloud, pleased her, and gave
an outline to the imagination to sketch
the individual form she wished to recognize.</p>

<p>Feeling the disappointment more
severely than she was willing to believe,
she flew to Rousseau, as her
only refuge from the idea of him, who
might prove a friend, could she but
find a way to interest him in her fate;
still the personification of Saint Preux,
or of an ideal lover far superior, was
after this imperfect model, of which
merely a glance had been caught,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-43" id="Pg_1-43"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-43.png">43</a>]</span>
even to the minuti&aelig; of the coat and
hat of the stranger. But if she lent
St. Preux, or the demi-god of her
fancy, his form, she richly repaid him
by the donation of all St. Preux's
sentiments and feelings, culled to gratify
her own, to which he seemed to
have an undoubted right, when she
read on the margin of an impassioned
letter, written in the well-known hand&mdash;"Rousseau
alone, the true Prometheus
of sentiment, possessed the fire
of genius necessary to pourtray the
passion, the truth of which goes so
directly to the heart."</p>

<p>Maria was again true to the hour, yet
had finished Rousseau, and begun to
transcribe some selected passages; unable
to quit either the author or the window,
before she had a glimpse of the
countenance she daily longed to see;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-44" id="Pg_1-44"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-44.png">44</a>]</span>
and, when seen, it conveyed no distinct
idea to her mind where she had
seen it before. He must have been a
transient acquaintance; but to discover
an acquaintance was fortunate, could
she contrive to attract his attention,
and excite his sympathy.</p>

<p>Every glance afforded colouring for
the picture she was delineating on her
heart; and once, when the window
was half open, the sound of his voice
reached her. Conviction flashed on
her; she had certainly, in a moment
of distress, heard the same accents.
They were manly, and characteristic
of a noble mind; nay, even sweet&mdash;or
sweet they seemed to her attentive
ear.</p>

<p>She started back, trembling, alarmed
at the emotion a strange coincidence
of circumstances inspired, and wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-45" id="Pg_1-45"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-45.png">45</a>]</span>ing
why she thought so much of a
stranger, obliged as she had been by
his timely interference; [for she recollected,
by degrees, all the circumstances
of their former meeting.] She
found however that she could think
of nothing else; or, if she thought of
her daughter, it was to wish that she
had a father whom her mother could
respect and love.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_III" id="CHAP_III"></a>CHAP. III.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> perusing the first parcel of
books, Maria had, with her pencil, written
in one of them a few exclamations,
expressive of compassion and sympathy,
which she scarcely remembered, till
turning over the leaves of one of the
volumes, lately brought to her, a slip
of paper dropped out, which Jemima
hastily snatched up.</p>

<p>"Let me see it," demanded Maria
impatiently, "You surely are not
afraid of trusting me with the effusions
of a madman?" "I must consider," replied
Jemima; and withdrew, with
the paper in her hand.</p>

<p>In a life of such seclusion, the passions
gain undue force; Maria therefore
felt a great degree of resentment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-47" id="Pg_1-47"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-47.png">47</a>]</span>
vexation, which she had not time to
subdue, before Jemima, returning, delivered
the paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whoever you are, who partake of
my fate, accept my sincere commiseration&mdash;I
would have said protection;
but the privilege of man is denied me.</p>

<p>"My own situation forces a dreadful
suspicion on my mind&mdash;I may not always
languish in vain for freedom&mdash;say
are you&mdash;I cannot ask the question;
yet I will remember you when my remembrance
can be of any use. I will
enquire, <i>why</i> you are so mysteriously
detained&mdash;and I <i>will</i> have an answer.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">henry darnford</span>."</p></div>

<p>By the most pressing intreaties, Maria
prevailed on Jemima to permit her to
write a reply to this note. Another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-48" id="Pg_1-48"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-48.png">48</a>]</span>
and another succeeded, in which explanations
were not allowed relative to
their present situation; but Maria, with
sufficient explicitness, alluded to a former
obligation; and they insensibly entered
on an interchange of sentiments
on the most important subjects. To
write these letters was the business of
the day, and to receive them the moment
of sunshine. By some means,
Darnford having discovered Maria's
window, when she next appeared at
it, he made her, behind his keepers, a
profound bow of respect and recognition.</p>

<p>Two or three weeks glided away in
this kind of intercourse, during which
period Jemima, to whom Maria had
given the necessary information respecting
her family, had evidently gained
some intelligence, which increased her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-49" id="Pg_1-49"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-49.png">49</a>]</span>
desire of pleasing her charge, though
she could not yet determine to liberate
her. Maria took advantage of this
favourable charge, without too minutely
enquiring into the cause; and such
was her eagerness to hold human converse,
and to see her former protector,
still a stranger to her, that she incessantly
requested her guard to gratify her more
than curiosity.</p>

<p>Writing to Darnford, she was led
from the sad objects before her, and
frequently rendered insensible to the
horrid noises around her, which previously
had continually employed her
feverish fancy. Thinking it selfish to
dwell on her own sufferings, when in
the midst of wretches, who had not
only lost all that endears life, but their
very selves, her imagination was oc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-50" id="Pg_1-50"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-50.png">50</a>]</span>cupied
with melancholy earnestness to
trace the mazes of misery, through
which so many wretches must have
passed to this gloomy receptacle of disjointed
souls, to the grand source of
human corruption. Often at midnight
was she waked by the dismal shrieks of
demoniac rage, or of excruciating despair,
uttered in such wild tones of indescribable
anguish as proved the total
absence of reason, and roused phantoms
of horror in her mind, far more
terrific than all that dreaming superstition
ever drew. Besides, there was
frequently something so inconceivably
picturesque in the varying gestures of
unrestrained passion, so irresistibly comic
in their sallies, or so heart-piercingly
pathetic in the little airs they would
sing, frequently bursting out after an
awful silence, as to fascinate the at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-51" id="Pg_1-51"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-51.png">51</a>]</span>tention,
and amuse the fancy, while
torturing the soul. It was the uproar
of the passions which she was compelled
to observe; and to mark the
lucid beam of reason, like a light
trembling in a socket, or like the
flash which divides the threatening
clouds of angry heaven only to display
the horrors which darkness shrouded.</p>

<p>Jemima would labour to beguile the
tedious evenings, by describing the
persons and manners of the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unfortutunate'">unfortunate</ins>
beings, whose figures or voices
awoke sympathetic sorrow in Maria's
bosom; and the stories she told were
the more interesting, for perpetually
leaving room to conjecture something
extraordinary. Still Maria, accustomed
to generalize her observations, was
led to conclude from all she heard,
that it was a vulgar error to suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-52" id="Pg_1-52"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-52.png">52</a>]</span>
that people of abilities were the most
apt to lose the command of reason.
On the contrary, from most of the instances
she could investigate, she thought
it resulted, that the passions only appeared
strong and disproportioned, because
the judgment was weak and unexercised;
and that they gained strength
by the decay of reason, as the shadows
lengthen during the sun's decline.</p>

<p>Maria impatiently wished to see her
fellow-sufferer; but Darnford was still
more earnest to obtain an interview.
Accustomed to submit to every impulse
of passion, and never taught, like
women, to restrain the most natural,
and acquire, instead of the bewitching
frankness of nature, a factitious propriety
of behaviour, every desire became
a torrent that bore down all opposition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-53" id="Pg_1-53"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-53.png">53</a>]</span>
His travelling trunk, which contained
the books lent to Maria, had
been sent to him, and with a part of
its contents he bribed his principal
keeper; who, after receiving the most
solemn promise that he would return
to his apartment without attempting
to explore any part of the house, conducted
him, in the dusk of the evening,
to Maria's room.</p>

<p>Jemima had apprized her charge of
the visit, and she expected with trembling
impatience, inspired by a vague
hope that he might again prove her
deliverer, to see a man who had before
rescued her from oppression. He entered
with an animation of countenance,
formed to captivate an enthusiast;
and, hastily turned his eyes from
her to the apartment, which he surveyed
with apparent emotions of com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-54" id="Pg_1-54"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-54.png">54</a>]</span>passionate
indignation. Sympathy illuminated
his eye, and, taking her hand,
he respectfully bowed on it, exclaiming&mdash;"This
is extraordinary!&mdash;again
to meet you, and in such circumstances!"
Still, impressive as was the
coincidence of events which brought
them once more together, their full
hearts did not overflow.&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_54-A_3" id="FNanchor_54-A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_54-A_3" class="fnanchor">[54-A]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>[And though, after this first visit,
they were permitted frequently to repeat
their interviews, they were for
some time employed in] a reserved
conversation, to which all the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-55" id="Pg_1-55"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-55.png">55</a>]</span>
might have listened; excepting, when
discussing some literary subject, flashes
of sentiment, inforced by each relaxing
feature, seemed to remind them
that their minds were already acquainted.</p>

<p>[By degrees, Darnford entered into
the particulars of his story.] In a few
words, he informed her that he had been
a thoughtless, extravagant young man;
yet, as he described his faults, they appeared
to be the generous luxuriancy of
a noble mind. Nothing like meanness
tarnished the lustre of his youth, nor had
the worm of selfishness lurked in the unfolding
bud, even while he had been the
dupe of others. Yet he tardily acquired
the experience necessary to guard
him against future imposition.</p>

<p>"I shall weary you," continued he,
"by my egotism; and did not power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-56" id="Pg_1-56"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-56.png">56</a>]</span>ful
emotions draw me to you,"&mdash;his
eyes glistened as he spoke, and a trembling
seemed to run through his manly
frame,&mdash;"I would not waste these precious
moments in talking of myself.</p>

<p>"My father and mother were people
of fashion; married by their parents. He
was fond of the turf, she of the card-table.
I, and two or three other children
since dead, were kept at home
till we became intolerable. My father
and mother had a visible dislike
to each other, continually displayed;
the servants were of the depraved kind
usually found in the houses of people
of fortune. My brothers and parents
all dying, I was left to the care of
guardians, and sent to Eton. I never
knew the sweets of domestic affection,
but I felt the want of indulgence and
frivolous respect at school. I will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-57" id="Pg_1-57"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-57.png">57</a>]</span>
disgust you with a recital of the vices
of my youth, which can scarcely be comprehended
by female delicacy. I was
taught to love by a creature I am
ashamed to mention; and the other
women with whom I afterwards became
intimate, were of a class of which
you can have no knowledge. I formed
my acquaintance with them at the
theatres; and, when vivacity danced
in their eyes, I was not easily disgusted
by the vulgarity which flowed from
their lips. Having spent, a few years
after I was of age, [the whole of] a
considerable patrimony, excepting a
few hundreds, I had no <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'resource'">recourse</ins> but
to purchase a commission in a new-raised
regiment, destined to subjugate
America. The regret I felt to renounce
a life of pleasure, was counter-balanced
by the curiosity I had to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-58" id="Pg_1-58"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-58.png">58</a>]</span>
America, or rather to travel; [nor
had any of those circumstances occurred
to my youth, which might have
been calculated] to bind my country
to my heart. I shall not trouble you
with the details of a military life. My
blood was still kept in motion; till,
towards the close of the contest, I was
wounded and taken prisoner.</p>

<p>"Confined to my bed, or chair, by a
lingering cure, my only refuge from
the preying activity of my mind, was
books, which I read with great avidity,
profiting by the conversation of my
host, a man of sound understanding.
My political sentiments now underwent
a total change; and, dazzled by
the hospitality of the Americans, I
determined to take up my abode with
freedom. I, therefore, with my usual
impetuosity, sold my commission, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-59" id="Pg_1-59"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-59.png">59</a>]</span>
travelled into the interior parts of the
country, to lay out my money to advantage.
Added to this, I did not
much like the puritanical manners of
the large towns. Inequality of condition
was there most disgustingly galling.
The only pleasure wealth afforded,
was to make an ostentatious
display of it; for the cultivation of
the fine arts, or literature, had not introduced
into the first circles that polish
of manners which renders the rich so essentially
superior to the poor in Europe.
Added to this, an influx of vices had
been let in by the Revolution, and the
most rigid principles of religion shaken
to the centre, before the understanding
could be gradually emancipated from
the prejudices which led their ancestors
undauntedly to seek an inhospitable
clime and unbroken soil. The resolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-60" id="Pg_1-60"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-60.png">60</a>]</span>tion,
that led them, in pursuit of independence,
to embark on rivers like
seas, to search for unknown shores,
and to sleep under the hovering mists
of endless forests, whose baleful damps
agued their limbs, was now turned into
commercial speculations, till the national
character exhibited a phenomenon
in the history of the human mind&mdash;a
head enthusiastically enterprising, with
cold selfishness of heart. And woman,
lovely woman!&mdash;they charm every
where&mdash;still there is a degree of prudery,
and a want of taste and ease in
the manners of the American women,
that renders them, in spite of their roses
and lilies, far inferior to our European
charmers. In the country, they have
often a bewitching simplicity of character;
but, in the cities, they have all
the airs and ignorance of the ladies who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-61" id="Pg_1-61"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-61.png">61</a>]</span>
give the tone to the circles of the large
trading towns in England. They are
fond of their ornaments, merely because
they are good, and not because
they embellish their persons; and are
more gratified to inspire the women
with jealousy of these exterior advantages,
than the men with love. All
the frivolity which often (excuse me,
Madam) renders the society of modest
women so stupid in England, here
seemed to throw still more leaden fetters
on their charms. Not being an
adept in gallantry, I found that I could
only keep myself awake in their company
by making downright love to
them.</p>

<p>"But, not to intrude on your patience,
I retired to the track of land
which I had purchased in the country,
and my time passed pleasantly enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-62" id="Pg_1-62"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-62.png">62</a>]</span>
while I cut down the trees, built my
house, and planted my different crops.
But winter and idleness came, and I
longed for more elegant society, to hear
what was passing in the world, and to
do something better than vegetate with
the animals that made a very considerable
part of my household. Consequently,
I determined to travel. Motion was
a substitute for variety of objects; and,
passing over immense tracks of country,
I exhausted my exuberant spirits, without
obtaining much experience. I every
where saw industry the fore-runner
and not the consequence, of luxury;
but this country, every thing being on
an ample scale, did not afford those
picturesque views, which a certain degree
of cultivation is necessary gradually
to produce. The eye wandered
without an object to fix upon over im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-63" id="Pg_1-63"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-63.png">63</a>]</span>measureable
plains, and lakes that seemed
replenished by the ocean, whilst eternal
forests of small clustering trees, obstructed
the circulation of air, and embarrassed
the path, without gratifying
the eye of taste. No cottage smiling in
the waste, no travellers hailed us, to give
life to silent nature; or, if perchance
we saw the print of a footstep in our
path, it was a dreadful warning to turn
aside; and the head ached as if assailed
by the scalping knife. The Indians
who hovered on the skirts of the European
settlements had only learned of
their neighbours to plunder, and they
stole their guns from them to do it with
more safety.</p>

<p>"From the woods and back settlements,
I returned to the towns, and
learned to eat and drink most valiantly;
but without entering into commerce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-64" id="Pg_1-64"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-64.png">64</a>]</span>
(and I detested commerce) I found I
could not live there; and, growing heartily
weary of the land of liberty and
vulgar aristocracy, seated on her bags
of dollars, I resolved once more to visit
Europe. I wrote to a distant relation
in England, with whom I had been
educated, mentioning the vessel in
which I intended to sail. Arriving in
London, my senses were intoxicated. I
ran from street to street, from theatre
to theatre, and the women of the town
(again I must beg pardon for my habitual
frankness) appeared to me like
angels.</p>

<p>"A week was spent in this thoughtless
manner, when, returning very late
to the hotel in which I had lodged ever
since my arrival, I was knocked down
in a private street, and hurried, in a state
of insensibility, into a coach, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-65" id="Pg_1-65"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-65.png">65</a>]</span>
brought me hither, and I only recovered
my senses to be treated like one
who had lost them. My keepers are
deaf to my remonstrances and enquiries,
yet assure me that my confinement
shall not last long. Still I cannot guess,
though I weary myself with conjectures,
why I am confined, or in what
part of England this house is situated.
I imagine sometimes that I hear the
sea roar, and wished myself again on
the Atlantic, till I had a glimpse of

<h2><a name="CHAP_IV" id="CHAP_IV"></a>CHAP. IV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Pity</span>, and the forlorn seriousness of
adversity, have both been considered as
dispositions favourable to love, while
satirical writers have attributed the
propensity to the relaxing effect of
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing comma">idleness,</ins> what chance then had Maria
of escaping, when pity, sorrow,
and solitude all conspired to soften her
mind, and nourish romantic wishes,
and, from a natural progress, romantic
expectations?</p>

<p>Maria was six-and-twenty. But,
such was the native soundness of her
constitution, that time had only given
to her countenance the character of her
mind. Revolving thought, and exercised
affections had banished some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-68" id="Pg_1-68"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-68.png">68</a>]</span>
the playful graces of innocence, producing
insensibly that irregularity of
features which the struggles of the understanding
to trace or govern the
strong emotions of the heart, are wont
to imprint on the yielding mass. Grief
and care had mellowed, without obscuring,
the bright tints of youth, and
the thoughtfulness which resided on her
brow did not take from the feminine
softness of her features; nay, such was
the sensibility which often mantled over
it, that she frequently appeared, like a
large proportion of her sex, only born
to feel; and the activity of her well-proportioned,
and even almost voluptuous
figure, inspired the idea of
strength of mind, rather than of body.
There was a simplicity sometimes indeed
in her manner, which bordered
on infantine ingenuousness, that led peo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-69" id="Pg_1-69"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-69.png">69</a>]</span>ple
of common discernment to underrate
her talents, and smile at the flights
of her imagination. But those who
could not comprehend the delicacy of
her sentiments, were attached by her
unfailing sympathy, so that she was very
generally beloved by characters of very
different descriptions; still, she was too
much under the influence of an ardent
imagination to adhere to common rules.</p>

<p>There are mistakes of conduct which
at five-and-twenty prove the strength of
the mind, that, ten or fifteen years after,
would demonstrate its weakness, its incapacity
to acquire a sane judgment.
The youths who are satisfied with the
ordinary pleasures of life, and do not
sigh after ideal phantoms of love and
friendship, will never arrive at great maturity
of understanding; but if these reveries
are cherished, as is too frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-70" id="Pg_1-70"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-70.png">70</a>]</span>
the case with women, when experience
ought to have taught them in what human
happiness consists, they become as
useless as they are wretched. Besides,
their pains and pleasures are so dependent
on outward circumstances, on the
objects of their affections, that they
seldom act from the impulse of a nerved
mind, able to choose its own pursuit.</p>

<p>Having had to struggle incessantly
with the vices of mankind, Maria's
imagination found repose in pourtraying
the possible virtues the world might
contain. Pygmalion formed an ivory
maid, and longed for an informing soul.
She, on the contrary, combined all the
qualities of a hero's mind, and fate
presented a statue in which she might
enshrine them.</p>

<p>We mean not to trace the progress
of this passion, or recount how often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-71" id="Pg_1-71"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-71.png">71</a>]</span>
Darnford and Maria were obliged to
part in the midst of an interesting conversation.
Jemima ever watched on
the tip-toe of fear, and frequently separated
them on a false alarm, when
they would have given worlds to remain
a little longer together.</p>

<p>A magic lamp now seemed to be suspended
in Maria's prison, and fairy
landscapes flitted round the gloomy
walls, late so blank. Rushing from the
depth of despair, on the seraph wing of
hope, she found herself happy.&mdash;She was
beloved, and every emotion was rapturous.</p>

<p>To Darnford she had not shown a decided
affection; the fear of outrunning
his, a sure proof of love, made her often
assume a coldness and indifference foreign
from her character; and, even when
giving way to the playful emotions of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-72" id="Pg_1-72"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-72.png">72</a>]</span>
heart just loosened from the frozen
bond of grief, there was a delicacy in
her manner of expressing her sensibility,
which made him doubt whether it
was the effect of love.</p>

<p>One evening, when Jemima left them,
to listen to the sound of a distant footstep,
which seemed cautiously to approach,
he seized Maria's hand&mdash;it was
not withdrawn. They conversed with
earnestness of their situation; and, during
the conversation, he once or twice
gently drew her towards him. He felt
the fragrance of her breath, and longed,
yet feared, to touch the lips from
which it issued; spirits of purity seemed
to guard them, while all the enchanting
graces of love sported on her cheeks,
and languished in her eyes.</p>

<p>Jemima entering, he reflected on his
diffidence with poignant regret, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-73" id="Pg_1-73"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-73.png">73</a>]</span>
she once more taking alarm, he ventured,
as Maria stood near his chair, to
approach her lips with a declaration of
love. She drew back with solemnity,
he hung down his head abashed; but
lifting his eyes timidly, they met her's;
she had determined, during that instant,
and suffered their rays to mingle. He
took, with more ardour, reassured, a
half-consenting, half-reluctant kiss, reluctant
only from modesty; and there
was a sacredness in her dignified manner
of reclining her glowing face on
his shoulder, that powerfully impressed
him. Desire was lost in more ineffable
emotions, and to protect her from insult
and sorrow&mdash;to make her happy,
seemed not only the first wish of his heart,
but the most noble duty of his life.
Such angelic confidence demanded the
fidelity of honour; but could he, feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-74" id="Pg_1-74"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-74.png">74</a>]</span>ing
her in every pulsation, could he
ever change, could he be a villain? The
emotion with which she, for a moment,
allowed herself to be pressed to his bosom,
the tear of rapturous sympathy,
mingled with a soft melancholy sentiment
of recollected disappointment,
said&mdash;more of truth and faithfulness,
than the tongue could have given utterance
to in hours! They were silent&mdash;yet
discoursed, how eloquently? till,
after a moment's reflection, Maria drew
her chair by the side of his, and, with
a composed sweetness of voice, and
supernatural benignity of countenance,
said, "I must open my whole heart
to you; you must be told who I am,
why I am here, and why, telling you
I am a wife, I blush not to"&mdash;the blush
spoke the rest.</p>

<p>Jemima was again at her elbow, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-75" id="Pg_1-75"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-75.png">75</a>]</span>
the restraint of her presence did not
prevent an animated conversation, in
which love, sly urchin, was ever at bo-peep.</p>

<p>So much of heaven did they enjoy,
that paradise bloomed around them; or
they, by a powerful spell, had been
transported into Armida's garden. Love,
the grand enchanter, "lapt them in Elysium,"
and every sense was harmonized
to joy and social extacy. So animated,
indeed, were their accents of tenderness,
in discussing what, in other circumstances,
would have been common-place
subjects, that Jemima felt, with
surprise, a tear of pleasure trickling
down her rugged cheeks. She wiped
it away, half ashamed; and when Maria
kindly enquired the cause, with all
the eager solicitude of a happy being
wishing to impart to all nature its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-76" id="Pg_1-76"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-76.png">76</a>]</span>
overflowing felicity, Jemima owned
that it was the first tear that social enjoyment
had ever drawn from her. She
seemed indeed to breathe more freely;
the cloud of suspicion cleared away
from her brow; she felt herself, for
once in her life, treated like a fellow-creature.</p>

<p>Imagination! who can paint thy
power; or reflect the evanescent tints
of hope fostered by thee? A despondent
gloom had long obscured Maria's horizon&mdash;now
the sun broke forth, the
rainbow appeared, and every prospect
was fair. Horror still reigned in the
darkened cells, suspicion lurked in the
passages, and whispered along the
walls. The yells of men possessed,
sometimes made them pause, and wonder
that they felt so happy, in a tomb
of living death. They even chid them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-77" id="Pg_1-77"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-77.png">77</a>]</span>selves
for such apparent insensibility;
still the world contained not three happier
beings. And Jemima, after again
patrolling the passage, was so softened
by the air of confidence which breathed
around her, that she voluntarily began
an account of herself.</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-78" id="Pg_1-78"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-78.png">78</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAP_V" id="CHAP_V"></a>CHAP. V.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> father," said Jemima, "seduced
my mother, a pretty girl, with whom
he lived fellow-servant; and she no
sooner perceived the natural, the dreaded
consequence, than the terrible conviction
flashed on her&mdash;that she was
ruined. Honesty, and a regard for her
reputation, had been the only principles
inculcated by her mother; and
they had been so forcibly impressed, that
she feared shame, more than the poverty
to which it would lead. Her incessant
importunities to prevail upon my father
to screen her from reproach by marrying
her, as he had promised in the
fervour of seduction, estranged him from
her so completely, that her very person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-79" id="Pg_1-79"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-79.png">79</a>]</span>
became distasteful to him; and he began
to hate, as well as despise me, before
I was born.</p>

<p>"My mother, grieved to the soul by
his neglect, and unkind treatment, actually
resolved to famish herself; and
injured her health by the attempt;
though she had not sufficient resolution
to adhere to her project, or renounce it
entirely. Death came not at her call;
yet sorrow, and the methods she adopted
to conceal her condition, still doing the
work of a house-maid, had such an
effect on her constitution, that she died
in the wretched garret, where her virtuous
mistress had forced her to take
refuge in the very pangs of labour,
though my father, after a slight reproof,
was allowed to remain in his place&mdash;allowed
by the mother of six children,
who, scarcely permitting a footstep to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-80" id="Pg_1-80"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-80.png">80</a>]</span>
be heard, during her month's indulgence,
felt no sympathy for the poor
wretch, denied every comfort required
by her situation.</p>

<p>"The day my mother died, the
ninth after my birth, I was consigned
to the care of the cheapest nurse my
father could find; who suckled her own
child at the same time, and lodged as
many more as she could get, in two
cellar-like apartments.</p>

<p>"Poverty, and the habit of seeing
children die off her hands, had so
hardened her heart, that the office of a
mother did not awaken the tenderness
of a woman; nor were the feminine
caresses which seem a part of the rearing
of a child, ever bestowed on me.
The chicken has a wing to shelter under;
but I had no bosom to nestle in,
no kindred warmth to foster me. Left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-81" id="Pg_1-81"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-81.png">81</a>]</span>
in dirt, to cry with cold and hunger
till I was weary, and sleep without ever
being prepared by exercise, or lulled
by kindness to rest; could I be expected
to become any thing but a weak and
rickety babe? Still, in spite of neglect,
I continued to exist, to learn to
curse existence,<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads '['">"</ins> her countenance grew
ferocious as she spoke, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads ']'">"</ins>and the treatment
that rendered me miserable, seemed
to sharpen my wits. Confined then
in a damp hovel, to rock the cradle of
the succeeding tribe, I looked like a
little old woman, or a hag shrivelling into
nothing. The furrows of reflection and
care contracted the youthful cheek,
and gave a sort of supernatural wildness
to the ever watchful eye. During
this period, my father had married another
fellow-servant, who loved him
less, and knew better how to manage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-82" id="Pg_1-82"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-82.png">82</a>]</span>
his passion, than my mother. She likewise
proving with child, they agreed
to keep a shop: my step-mother, if, being
an illegitimate offspring, I may
venture thus to characterize her, having
obtained a sum of a rich relation,
for that purpose.</p>

<p>"Soon after her lying-in, she prevailed
on my father to take me home, to save
the expence of maintaining me, and
of hiring a girl to assist her in the care
of the child. I was young, it was true,
but appeared a knowing little thing,
and might be made handy. Accordingly
I was brought to her house; but
not to a home&mdash;for a home I never
knew. Of this child, a daughter, she
was extravagantly fond; and it was a
part of my employment, to assist to spoil
her, by humouring all her whims, and
bearing all her caprices. Feeling her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-83" id="Pg_1-83"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-83.png">83</a>]</span>
own consequence, before she could
speak, she had learned the art of tormenting
me, and if I ever dared to resist,
I received blows, laid on with no
compunctious hand, or was sent to bed
dinnerless, as well as supperless. I said
that it was a part of my daily labour to
attend this child, with the servility of a
slave; still it was but a part. I was
sent out in all seasons, and from place
to place, to carry burdens far above
my strength, without being allowed to
draw near the fire, or ever being
cheered by encouragement or kindness.
No wonder then, treated like a
creature of another species, that I began
to envy, and at length to hate,
the darling of the house. Yet, I perfectly
remember, that it was the caresses,
and kind expressions of my step-mother,
which first excited my jealous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-84" id="Pg_1-84"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-84.png">84</a>]</span>
discontent. Once, I cannot forget it,
when she was calling in vain her wayward
child to kiss her, I ran to her,
saying, 'I will kiss you, ma'am!' and
how did my heart, which was in my
mouth, sink, what was my debasement
of soul, when pushed away with&mdash;'I
do not want you, pert thing!'
Another day, when a new gown had
excited the highest good humour, and
she uttered the appropriate <i>dear</i>, addressed
unexpectedly to me, I thought
I could never do enough to please her;
I was all alacrity, and rose proportionably
in my own estimation.</p>

<p>"As her daughter grew up, she was
pampered with cakes and fruit, while
I was, literally speaking, fed with the
refuse of the table, with her leavings.
A liquorish tooth is, I believe, common
to children, and I used to steal any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-85" id="Pg_1-85"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-85.png">85</a>]</span>
thing sweet, that I could catch up with
a chance of concealment. When detected,
she was not content to chastize
me herself at the moment, but, on my
father's return in the evening (he was
a shopman), the principal discourse was
to recount my faults, and attribute
them to the wicked disposition which I
had brought into the world with me,
inherited from my mother. He did not
fail to leave the marks of his resentment
on my body, and then solaced
himself by playing with my sister.&mdash;I
could have murdered her at those moments.
To save myself from these unmerciful
corrections, I resorted to falshood,
and the untruths which I sturdily
maintained, were brought in judgment
against me, to support my tyrant's
inhuman charge of my natural propensity
to vice. Seeing me treated with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-86" id="Pg_1-86"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-86.png">86</a>]</span>
contempt, and always being fed and
dressed better, my sister conceived a
contemptuous opinion of me, that
proved an obstacle to all affection; and
my father, hearing continually of my
faults, began to consider me as a curse
entailed on him for his sins: he was
therefore easily prevailed on to bind
me apprentice to one of my step-mother's
friends, who kept a slop-shop in
Wapping. I was represented (as it
was said) in my true colours; but she,
'warranted,' snapping her fingers,
'that she should break my spirit or
heart.'</p>

<p>"My mother replied, with a whine,
'that if any body could make me better,
it was such a clever woman as herself;
though, for her own part, she had
tried in vain; but good-nature was her
fault.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-87" id="Pg_1-87"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-87.png">87</a>]</span>
"I shudder with horror, when I recollect
the treatment I had now to endure.
Not only under the lash of my task-mistress,
but the drudge of the maid,
apprentices and children, I never had
a taste of human kindness to soften the
rigour of perpetual labour. I had been
introduced as an object of abhorrence
into the family; as a creature of whom
my step-mother, though she had been
kind enough to let me live in the house
with her own child, could make nothing.
I was described as a wretch,
whose nose must be kept to the grinding
stone&mdash;and it was held there with
an iron grasp. It seemed indeed the
privilege of their superior nature to kick
me about, like the dog or cat. If I
were attentive, I was called fawning,
if refractory, an obstinate mule, and
like a mule I received their censure on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-88" id="Pg_1-88"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-88.png">88</a>]</span>
my loaded back. Often has my mistress,
for some instance of forgetfulness, thrown
me from one side of the kitchen to the
other, knocked my head against the
wall, spit in my face, with various refinements
on barbarity that I forbear to
enumerate, though they were all acted
over again by the servant, with additional
insults, to which the appellation
of <i>bastard</i>, was commonly added, with
taunts or sneers. But I will not attempt
to give you an adequate idea of
my situation, lest you, who probably
have never been drenched with the
dregs of human misery, should think I
exaggerate.</p>

<p>"I stole now, from absolute necessity,&mdash;bread;
yet whatever else was
taken, which I had it not in my power
to take, was ascribed to me. I was
the filching cat, the ravenous dog, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-89" id="Pg_1-89"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-89.png">89</a>]</span>
dumb brute, who must bear all; for if
I endeavoured to exculpate myself, I
was silenced, without any enquiries
being made, with 'Hold your tongue,
you never tell truth.' Even the very
air I breathed was tainted with scorn;
for I was sent to the neighbouring shops
with Glutton, Liar, or Thief, written on
my forehead. This was, at first, the
most bitter punishment; but sullen
pride, or a kind of stupid desperation,
made me, at length, almost regardless
of the contempt, which had wrung
from me so many solitary tears at the
only moments when I was allowed to
rest.</p>

<p>"Thus was I the mark of cruelty till
my sixteenth year; and then I have
only to point out a change of misery;
for a period I never knew. Allow me
first to make one observation. Now I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-90" id="Pg_1-90"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-90.png">90</a>]</span>
look back, I cannot help attributing the
greater part of my misery, to the misfortune
of having been thrown into the
world without the grand support of life&mdash;a
mother's affection. I had no one to
love me; or to make me respected, to
enable me to acquire respect. I was an
egg dropped on the sand; a pauper by
nature, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hunted'">shunted</ins> from family to family,
who belonged to nobody&mdash;and nobody
cared for me. I was despised from my
birth, and denied the chance of obtaining
a footing for myself in society. Yes;
I had not even the chance of being
considered as a fellow-creature&mdash;yet all
the people with whom I lived, brutalized
as they were by the low cunning
of trade, and the despicable shifts of
poverty, were not without bowels,
though they never yearned for me. I
was, in fact, born a slave, and chained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-91" id="Pg_1-91"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-91.png">91</a>]</span>
by infamy to slavery during the whole
of existence, without having any companions
to alleviate it by sympathy, or
teach me how to rise above it by their
example. But, to resume the thread of
my tale&mdash;</p>

<p>"At sixteen, I suddenly grew tall,
and something like comeliness appeared
on a Sunday, when I had time to wash
my face, and put on clean clothes. My
master had once or twice caught hold
of me in the passage; but I instinctively
avoided his disgusting caresses. One
day however, when the family were
at a methodist meeting, he contrived to
be alone in the house with me, and by
blows&mdash;yes; blows and menaces, compelled
me to submit to his ferocious
desire; and, to avoid my mistress's
fury, I was obliged in future to comply,
and skulk to my loft at his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-92" id="Pg_1-92"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-92.png">92</a>]</span>mand,
in spite of increasing loathing.</p>

<p>"The anguish which was now pent
up in my bosom, seemed to open a new
world to me: I began to extend my
thoughts beyond myself, and grieve
for human misery, till I discovered,
with horror&mdash;ah! what horror!&mdash;that I
was with child. I know not why I felt
a mixed sensation of despair and tenderness,
excepting that, ever called a
bastard, a bastard appeared to me an
object of the greatest compassion in
creation.</p>

<p>"I communicated this dreadful circumstance
to my master, who was almost
equally alarmed at the intelligence;
for he feared his wife, and public
censure at the meeting. After some
weeks of deliberation had elapsed, I in
continual fear that my altered shape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-93" id="Pg_1-93"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-93.png">93</a>]</span>
would be noticed, my master gave me
a medicine in a phial, which he desired
me to take, telling me, without any
circumlocution, for what purpose it
was designed. I burst into tears, I
thought it was killing myself&mdash;yet was
such a self as I worth preserving? He
cursed me for a fool, and left me to my
own reflections. I could not resolve to
take this infernal potion; but I wrapped
it up in an old gown, and hid it
in a corner of my box.</p>

<p>"Nobody yet suspected me, because
they had been accustomed to view me
as a creature of another species. But
the threatening storm at last broke over
my devoted head&mdash;never shall I forget
it! One Sunday evening when I was
left, as usual, to take care of the house,
my master came home intoxicated, and
I became the prey of his brutal appe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-94" id="Pg_1-94"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-94.png">94</a>]</span>tite.
His extreme intoxication made
him forget his customary caution, and
my mistress entered and found us in a
situation that could not have been more
hateful to her than me. Her husband
was 'pot-valiant,' he feared her not
at the moment, nor had he then much
reason, for she instantly turned the
whole force of her anger another
way. She tore off my cap, scratched,
kicked, and buffetted me, till she had
exhausted her strength, declaring, as she
rested her arm, 'that I had wheedled
her husband from her.&mdash;But, could any
thing better be expected from a wretch,
whom she had taken into her house out
of pure charity?' What a torrent of
abuse rushed out? till, almost breathless,
she concluded with saying, 'that I
was born a strumpet; it ran in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-95" id="Pg_1-95"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-95.png">95</a>]</span>
blood, and nothing good could come
to those who harboured me.'</p>

<p>"My situation was, of course, discovered,
and she declared that I should
not stay another night under the same
roof with an honest family. I was
therefore pushed out of doors, and my
trumpery thrown after me, when it had
been contemptuously examined in the
passage, lest I should have stolen any
thing.</p>

<p>"Behold me then in the street, utterly
destitute! Whither could I creep for
shelter? To my father's roof I had no
claim, when not pursued by shame&mdash;now
I shrunk back as from death, from
my mother's cruel reproaches, my father's
execrations. I could not endure
to hear him curse the day I was born,
though life had been a curse to me. Of
death I thought, but with a confused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-96" id="Pg_1-96"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-96.png">96</a>]</span>
emotion of terror, as I stood leaning
my head on a post, and starting at every
footstep, lest it should be my mistress
coming to tear my heart out. One of
the boys of the shop passing by, heard
my tale, and immediately repaired to
his master, to give him a description of
my situation; and he touched the right
key&mdash;the scandal it would give rise to,
if I were left to repeat my tale to every
enquirer. This plea came home to his
reason, who had been sobered by his
wife's rage, the fury of which fell on
him when I was out of her reach, and
he sent the boy to me with half-a-guinea,
desiring him to conduct me to a
house, where beggars, and other
wretches, the refuse of society, nightly
lodged.</p>

<p>"This night was spent in a state of
stupefaction, or desperation. I detested
mankind, and abhorred myself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-97" id="Pg_1-97"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-97.png">97</a>]</span>
"In the morning I ventured out, to
throw myself in my master's way, at his
usual hour of going abroad. I approached
him, he 'damned me for a
b&mdash;&mdash;, declared I had disturbed the
peace of the family, and that he had
sworn to his wife, never to take any
more notice of me.' He left me; but,
instantly returning, he told me that he
should speak to his friend, a parish-officer,
to get a nurse for the brat I laid
to him; and advised me, if I wished to
keep out of the house of correction, not
to make free with his name.</p>

<p>"I hurried back to my hole, and, rage
giving place to despair, sought for the
potion that was to procure abortion, and
swallowed it, with a wish that it might
destroy me, at the same time that it
stopped the sensations of new-born life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-98" id="Pg_1-98"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-98.png">98</a>]</span>
which I felt with indescribable emotion.
My head turned round, my heart grew
sick, and in the horrors of approaching
dissolution, mental anguish was swallowed
up. The effect of the medicine
was violent, and I was confined to my
bed several days; but, youth and a
strong constitution prevailing, I once
more crawled out, to ask myself the
cruel question, 'Whither I should
go?' I had but two shillings left in
my pocket, the rest had been expended,
by a poor woman who slept in the
same room, to pay for my lodging,
and purchase the necessaries of which
she partook.</p>

<p>"With this wretch I went into the
neighbouring streets to beg, and my
disconsolate appearance drew a few
pence from the idle, enabling me still
to command a bed; till, recovering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-99" id="Pg_1-99"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-99.png">99</a>]</span>
from my illness, and taught to put on
my rags to the best advantage, I was
accosted from different motives, and
yielded to the desire of the brutes I met,
with the same detestation that I had
felt for my still more brutal master.
I have since read in novels of the blandishments
of seduction, but I had not
even the pleasure of being enticed
into vice.</p>

<p>"I shall not," interrupted Jemima,
"lead your imagination into all the
scenes of wretchedness and depravity,
which I was condemned to view; or
mark the different stages of my debasing
misery. Fate dragged me
through the very kennels of society;
I was still a slave, a bastard, a common
property. Become familiar with vice,
for I wish to conceal nothing from you,
I picked the pockets of the drunkards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-100" id="Pg_1-100"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-100.png">100</a>]</span>
who abused me; and proved by my
conduct, that I deserved the epithets,
with which they loaded me at moments
when distrust ought to cease.</p>

<p>"Detesting my nightly occupation,
though valuing, if I may so use the
word, my independence, which only
consisted in choosing the street in which
I should wander, or the roof, when I
had money, in which I should hide my
head, I was some time before I could
prevail on myself to accept of a place
in a house of ill fame, to which a girl,
with whom I had accidentally conversed
in the street, had recommended
me. I had been hunted almost into a
a fever, by the watchmen of the quarter
of the town I frequented; one,
whom I had unwittingly offended, giving
the word to the whole pack. You
can scarcely conceive the tyranny ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-101" id="Pg_1-101"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-101.png">101</a>]</span>ercised
by these wretches: considering
themselves as the instruments of
the very laws they violate, the pretext
which steels their conscience, hardens
their heart. Not content with receiving
from us, outlaws of society (let
other women talk of favours) a brutal
gratification gratuitously as a privilege
of office, they extort a tithe of prostitution,
and harrass with threats the
poor creatures whose occupation affords
not the means to silence the growl of
avarice. To escape from this persecution,
I once more entered into servitude.</p>

<p>"A life of comparative regularity
restored my health; and&mdash;do not start&mdash;my
manners were improved, in a situation
where vice sought to render itself
alluring, and taste was cultivated to
fashion the person, if not to refine the
mind. Besides, the common civility of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-102" id="Pg_1-102"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-102.png">102</a>]</span>
speech, contrasted with the gross vulgarity
to which I had been accustomed,
was something like the polish of civilization.
I was not shut out from all intercourse
of humanity. Still I was galled
by the yoke of service, and my mistress
often flying into violent fits of passion,
made me dread a sudden dismission,
which I understood was always the
case. I was therefore prevailed on,
though I felt a horror of men, to accept
the offer of a gentleman, rather in the
decline of years, to keep his house,
pleasantly situated in a little village
near Hampstead.</p>

<p>"He was a man of great talents, and
of brilliant wit; but, a worn-out votary
of voluptuousness, his desires became
fastidious in proportion as they
grew weak, and the native tenderness
of his heart was undermined by a vi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-103" id="Pg_1-103"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-103.png">103</a>]</span>tiated
imagination. A thoughtless <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'carreer'">career</ins>
of libertinism and social enjoyment,
had injured his health to such a
degree, that, whatever pleasure his conversation
afforded me (and my esteem
was ensured by proofs of the generous
humanity of his disposition), the being
his mistress was purchasing it at a very
dear rate. With such a keen perception
of the delicacies of sentiment,
with an imagination invigorated by
the exercise of genius, how could he
sink into the grossness of sensuality!</p>

<p>"But, to pass over a subject which I
recollect with pain, I must remark to
you, as an answer to your often-repeated
question, 'Why my sentiments and
language were superior to my station?'
that I now began to read, to beguile
the tediousness of solitude, and to
gratify an inquisitive, active mind. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-104" id="Pg_1-104"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-104.png">104</a>]</span>
had often, in my childhood, followed a
ballad-singer, to hear the sequel of a
dismal story, though sure of being severely
punished for delaying to return
with whatever I was sent to purchase. I
could just spell and put a sentence together,
and I listened to the various arguments,
though often mingled with
obscenity, which occurred at the table
where I was allowed to preside: for a
literary friend or two frequently came
home with my master, to dine and pass
the night. Having lost the privileged respect
of my sex, my presence, instead
of restraining, perhaps gave the reins
to their tongues; still I had the advantage
of hearing discussions, from which,
in the common course of life, women
are excluded.</p>

<p>"You may easily imagine, that it
was only by degrees that I could com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-105" id="Pg_1-105"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-105.png">105</a>]</span>prehend
some of the subjects they investigated,
or acquire from their reasoning
what might be termed a moral
sense. But my fondness of reading increasing,
and my master occasionally
shutting himself up in this retreat, for
weeks together, to write, I had many
opportunities of improvement. At
first, considering money <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '(I was right!&quot; exclaimed'">I was right!" (</ins>exclaimed Jemima, altering her tone of
voice) "as the only means, after my loss
of reputation, of obtaining respect, or
even the toleration of humanity, I had
not the least scruple to secrete a part of
the sums intrusted to me, and to screen
myself from detection by a system of
falshood. But, acquiring new principles,
I began to have the ambition of
returning to the respectable part of society,
and was weak enough to suppose
it possible. The attention of my unas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-106" id="Pg_1-106"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-106.png">106</a>]</span>suming
instructor, who, without being
ignorant of his own powers, possessed
great simplicity of manners, strengthened
the illusion. Having sometimes
caught up hints for thought, from my
untutored remarks, he often led me to
discuss the subjects he was treating,
and would read to me his productions,
previous to their publication, wishing
to profit by the criticism of unsophisticated
feeling. The aim of his writings
was to touch the simple springs of
the heart; for he despised the would-be
oracles, the self-elected philosophers,
who fright away fancy, while sifting
each grain of thought to prove that
slowness of comprehension is wisdom.</p>

<p>"I should have distinguished this as
a moment of sunshine, a happy period
in my life, had not the repugnance the
disgusting libertinism of my protector<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-107" id="Pg_1-107"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-107.png">107</a>]</span>
inspired, daily become more painful.&mdash;And,
indeed, I soon did recollect it as
such with agony, when his sudden
death (for he had recourse to the most
exhilarating cordials to keep up the
convivial tone of his spirits) again
threw me into the desert of human society.
Had he had any time for reflection,
I am certain he would have
left the little property in his power to
me: but, attacked by the fatal apoplexy
in town, his heir, a man of
rigid morals, brought his wife with
him to take possession of the house and
effects, before I was even informed of
his death,&mdash;'to prevent,' as she took
care indirectly to tell me, 'such a
creature as she supposed me to be, from
purloining any of them, had I been
apprized of the event in time.'</p>

<p>"The grief I felt at the sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-108" id="Pg_1-108"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-108.png">108</a>]</span>
shock the information gave me, which
at first had nothing selfish in it, was
treated with contempt, and I was ordered
to pack up my clothes; and a few
trinkets and books, given me by the
generous deceased, were contested,
while they piously hoped, with a reprobating
shake of the head, 'that
God would have mercy on his sinful
soul!' With some difficulty, I obtained
my arrears of wages; but asking&mdash;such
is the spirit-grinding consequence
of poverty and infamy&mdash;for a character
for honesty and economy, which God
knows I merited, I was told by this&mdash;why
must I call her woman?&mdash;'that
it would go against her conscience to
recommend a kept mistress.' Tears
started in my eyes, burning tears; for
there are situations in which a wretch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-109" id="Pg_1-109"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-109.png">109</a>]</span>
is humbled by the contempt they are
conscious they do not deserve.</p>

<p>"I returned to the metropolis; but
the solitude of a poor lodging was inconceivably
dreary, after the society I
had enjoyed. To be cut off from human
converse, now I had been taught
to relish it, was to wander a ghost
among the living. Besides, I foresaw, to
aggravate the severity of my fate, that
my little pittance would soon melt
away. I endeavoured to obtain needlework;
but, not having been taught early,
and my hands being rendered clumsy
by hard work, I did not sufficiently excel
to be employed by the ready-made
linen shops, when so many women,
better qualified, were suing for it.
The want of a character prevented my
getting a place; for, irksome as servitude
would have been to me, I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-110" id="Pg_1-110"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-110.png">110</a>]</span>
have made another trial, had it been
feasible. Not that I disliked employment,
but the inequality of condition
to which I must have submitted.
I had acquired a taste for literature,
during the five years I had lived with
a literary man, occasionally conversing
with men of the first abilities of the
age; and now to descend to the lowest
vulgarity, was a degree of wretchedness
not to be imagined unfelt. I had
not, it is true, tasted the charms of affection,
but I had been familiar with
the graces of humanity.</p>

<p>"One of the gentlemen, whom I
had frequently dined in company with,
while I was treated like a companion,
met me in the street, and enquired
after my health. I seized the occasion,
and began to describe my situation;
but he was in haste to join, at dinner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-111" id="Pg_1-111"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-111.png">111</a>]</span>
a select party of choice spirits; therefore,
without waiting to hear me, he
impatiently put a guinea into my hand,
saying, 'It was a pity such a sensible
woman should be in distress&mdash;he wished
me well from his soul.'</p>

<p>"To another I wrote, stating my case,
and requesting advice. He was an advocate
for unequivocal sincerity; and
had often, in my presence, descanted
on the evils which arise in society from
the despotism of rank and riches.</p>

<p>"In reply, I received a long essay on
the energy of the human mind, with
continual allusions to his own force of
character. He added, 'That the woman
who could write such a letter as I
had sent him, could never be in want
of resources, were she to look into herself,
and exert her powers; misery was
the consequence of indolence, and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-112" id="Pg_1-112"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-112.png">112</a>]</span>
to my being shut out from society, it
was the lot of man to submit to certain
privations.'</p>

<p>"How often have I heard," said
Jemima, interrupting her narrative,
"in conversation, and read in books,
that every person willing to work may
find employment? It is the vague assertion,
I believe, of insensible indolence,
when it relates to men; but, with
respect to women, I am sure of its fallacy,
unless they will submit to the
most menial bodily labour; and even
to be employed at hard labour is out of
the reach of many, whose reputation
misfortune or folly has tainted.</p>

<p>"How writers, professing to be friends
to freedom, and the improvement of
morals, can assert that poverty is no
evil, I cannot imagine."</p>

<p>"No more can I," interrupted Ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-113" id="Pg_1-113"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-113.png">113</a>]</span>ria,
"yet they even expatiate on the
peculiar happiness of indigence, though
in what it can consist, excepting in
brutal rest, when a man can barely earn
a subsistence, I cannot imagine. The
mind is necessarily imprisoned in its
own little tenement; and, fully occupied
by keeping it in repair, has not
time to rove abroad for improvement.
The book of knowledge is closely
clasped, against those who must fulfil
their daily task of severe manual labour
or die; and curiosity, rarely excited by
thought or information, seldom moves
on the stagnate lake of ignorance."</p>

<p>"As far as I have been able to observe,"
replied Jemima, "prejudices,
caught up by chance, are obstinately
maintained by the poor, to the exclusion
of improvement; they have not
time to reason or reflect to any extent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-114" id="Pg_1-114"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-114.png">114</a>]</span>
or minds sufficiently exercised to adopt
the principles of action, which form
perhaps the only basis of contentment
in every station<a name="FNanchor_114-A_5" id="FNanchor_114-A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_114-A_5" class="fnanchor">[114-A]</a>."</p>

<hr />

<p>"And independence," said Darnford,
"they are necessarily strangers to,
even the independence of despising their
persecutors. If the poor are happy, or
can be happy, <i>things are very well as they
are</i>. And I cannot conceive on what
principle those writers contend for a
change of system, who support this
opinion. The authors on the other
side of the question are much more
consistent, who grant the fact; yet, insisting
that it is the lot of the majority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-115" id="Pg_1-115"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-115.png">115</a>]</span>
to be oppressed in this life, kindly turn
them over to another, to rectify the
false weights and measures of this, as
the only way to justify the dispensations
of Providence. I have not," continued
Darnford, "an opinion more firmly
fixed by observation in my mind, than
that, though riches may fail to produce
proportionate happiness, poverty most
commonly excludes it, by shutting up
all the avenues to improvement."</p>

<p>"And as for the affections," added
Maria, with a sigh, "how gross, and
even tormenting do they become, unless
regulated by an improving mind!
The culture of the heart ever, I believe,
keeps pace with that of the
mind. But pray go on," addressing
Jemima, "though your narrative gives
rise to the most painful reflections on
the present state of society."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-116" id="Pg_1-116"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-116.png">116</a>]</span>
"Not to trouble you," continued
she, "with a detailed description of all
the painful feelings of unavailing exertion,
I have only to tell you, that at
last I got recommended to wash in a
few families, who did me the favour
to admit me into their houses, without
the most strict enquiry, to wash from
one in the morning till eight at night,
for eighteen or twenty-pence a day.
On the happiness to be enjoyed over a
washing-tub I need not comment; yet
you will allow me to observe, that this
was a wretchedness of situation peculiar
to my sex. A man with half my industry,
and, I may say, abilities, could
have procured a decent livelihood, and
discharged some of the duties which
knit mankind together; whilst I, who
had acquired a taste for the rational, nay,
in honest pride let me assert it, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-117" id="Pg_1-117"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-117.png">117</a>]</span>
virtuous enjoyments of life, was cast
aside as the filth of society. Condemned
to labour, like a machine, only
to earn bread, and scarcely that, I became
melancholy and desperate.</p>

<p>"I have now to mention a circumstance
which fills me with remorse, and
fear it will entirely deprive me of your
esteem. A tradesman became attached
to me, and visited me frequently,&mdash;and
I at last obtained such a power over
him, that he offered to take me home
to his house.&mdash;Consider, dear madam,
I was famishing: wonder not that I became
a wolf!&mdash;The only reason for not
taking me home immediately, was the
having a girl in the house, with child
by him&mdash;and this girl&mdash;I advised him&mdash;yes,
I did! would I could forget it!&mdash;to
turn out of doors: and one night he
determined to follow my advice, Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-118" id="Pg_1-118"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-118.png">118</a>]</span>
wretch! she fell upon her knees, reminded
him that he had promised to
marry her, that her parents were honest!&mdash;What
did it avail?&mdash;She was turned
out.</p>

<p>"She approached her father's door,
in the skirts of London,&mdash;listened at
the shutters,&mdash;but could not knock. A
watchman had observed her go and
return several times&mdash;Poor wretch!&mdash;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads '['">"</ins> The
remorse Jemima spoke of, seemed
to be stinging her to the soul, as she
proceeded.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads ']'">"</ins></p>

<p>"She left it, and, approaching a
tub where horses were watered, she
sat down in it, and, with desperate resolution,
remained in that attitude&mdash;till
resolution was no longer necessary!</p>

<p>"I happened that morning to be
going out to wash, anticipating the
moment when I should escape from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-119" id="Pg_1-119"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-119.png">119</a>]</span>
such hard labour. I passed by, just as
some men, going to work, drew out
the stiff, cold corpse&mdash;Let me not recal
the horrid moment!&mdash;I recognized
her pale visage; I listened to the tale
told by the spectators, and my heart
did not burst. I thought of my own
state, and wondered how I could be
such a monster!&mdash;I worked hard; and,
returning home, I was attacked by a
fever. I suffered both in body and mind.
I determined not to live with the
wretch. But he did not try me; he
left the neighbourhood. I once more
returned to the wash-tub.</p>

<p>"Still this state, miserable as it was,
admitted of aggravation. Lifting one
day a heavy load, a tub fell against my
shin, and gave me great pain. I did
not pay much attention to the hurt,
till it became a serious wound; being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-120" id="Pg_1-120"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-120.png">120</a>]</span>
obliged to work as usual, or starve.
But, finding myself at length unable
to stand for any time, I thought of
getting into an hospital. Hospitals, it
should seem (for they are comfortless
abodes for the sick) were expressly endowed
for the reception of the friendless;
yet I, who had on that plea a
right to assistance, wanted the recommendation
of the rich and respectable,
and was several weeks languishing for admittance;
fees were demanded on entering;
and, what was still more unreasonable,
security for burying me, that expence
not coming into the letter of the
charity. A guinea was the stipulated sum&mdash;I
could as soon have raised a million;
and I was afraid to apply to the parish
for an order, lest they should have
passed me, I knew not whither. The
poor woman at whose house I lodged,
compassionating my state, got me into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-121" id="Pg_1-121"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-121.png">121</a>]</span>
the hospital; and the family where I
received the hurt, sent me five shillings,
three and six-pence of which I gave at
my admittance&mdash;I know not for what.</p>

<p>"My leg grew quickly better; but
I was dismissed before my cure was
completed, because I could not afford
to have my linen washed to appear decently,
as the virago of a nurse said,
when the gentlemen (the surgeons)
came. I cannot give you an adequate
idea of the wretchedness of an hospital;
every thing is left to the care of people
intent on gain. The attendants seem
to have lost all feeling of compassion in
the bustling discharge of their offices;
death is so familiar to them, that they
are not anxious to ward it off. Every
thing appeared to be conducted for the
accommodation of the medical men
and their pupils, who came to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-122" id="Pg_1-122"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-122.png">122</a>]</span>
experiments on the poor, for the benefit
of the rich. One of the physicians,
I must not forget to mention, gave me
half-a-crown, and ordered me some
wine, when I was at the lowest ebb. I
thought of making my case known to
the lady-like matron; but her forbidding
countenance prevented me. She
condescended to look on the patients,
and make general enquiries, two or
three times a week; but the nurses
knew the hour when the visit of ceremony
would commence, and every
thing was as it should be.</p>

<p>"After my dismission, I was more at
a loss than ever for a subsistence, and,
not to weary you with a repetition of
the same unavailing attempts, unable
to stand at the washing-tub, I began to
consider the rich and poor as natural
enemies, and became a thief from prin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-123" id="Pg_1-123"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-123.png">123</a>]</span>ciple.
I could not now cease to reason,
but I hated mankind. I despised myself,
yet I justified my conduct. I was
taken, tried, and condemned to six
months' imprisonment in a house of
correction. My soul recoils with horror
from the remembrance of the insults I
had to endure, till, branded with shame,
I was turned loose in the street, pennyless.
I wandered from street to street,
till, exhausted by hunger and fatigue, I
sunk down senseless at a door, where
I had vainly demanded a morsel of
bread. I was sent by the inhabitant to
the work-house, to which he had surlily
bid me go, saying, he 'paid enough
in conscience to the poor,' when, with
parched tongue, I implored his charity.
If those well-meaning people who exclaim
against beggars, were acquainted
with the treatment the poor receive in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-124" id="Pg_1-124"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-124.png">124</a>]</span>
many of these wretched asylums, they
would not stifle so easily involuntary
sympathy, by saying that they have all
parishes to go to, or wonder that the
poor dread to enter the gloomy walls.
What are the common run of work-houses,
but prisons, in which many
respectable old people, worn out by
immoderate labour, sink into the grave
in sorrow, to which they are carried
like dogs!"</p>

<p>Alarmed by some indistinct noise,
Jemima rose hastily to listen, and Maria,
turning to Darnford, said, "I have indeed
been shocked beyond expression
when I have met a pauper's funeral. A
coffin carried on the shoulders of three
or four ill-looking wretches, whom the
imagination might easily convert into a
band of assassins, hastening to conceal
the corpse, and quarrelling about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-125" id="Pg_1-125"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-125.png">125</a>]</span>
prey on their way. I know it is of
little consequence how we are consigned
to the earth; but I am led by
this brutal insensibility, to what even
the animal creation appears forcibly to
feel, to advert to the wretched, deserted
manner in which they died."</p>

<p>"True," rejoined Darnford, "and,
till the rich will give more than a part
of their wealth, till they will give time
and attention to the wants of the distressed,
never let them boast of charity.
Let them open their hearts, and not
their purses, and employ their minds
in the service, if they are really actuated
by humanity; or charitable institutions
will always be the prey of the
lowest order of knaves."</p>

<p>Jemima returning, seemed in haste
to finish her tale. "The overseer
farmed the poor of different parishes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-126" id="Pg_1-126"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-126.png">126</a>]</span>
and out of the bowels of poverty was
wrung the money with which he purchased
this dwelling, as a private receptacle
for madness. He had been
a keeper at a house of the same description,
and conceived that he could
make money much more readily in his
old occupation. He is a shrewd&mdash;shall
I say it?&mdash;villain. He observed something
resolute in my manner, and offered
to take me with him, and instruct
me how to treat the disturbed minds he
meant to intrust to my care. The
offer of forty pounds a year, and to quit

though the condition of shutting my
eyes and hardening my heart was annexed
to it.</p>

<p>"I agreed to accompany him; and
four years have I been attendant on
many wretches, and"&mdash;she lowered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-127" id="Pg_1-127"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-127.png">127</a>]</span>
her voice,&mdash;"the witness of many
enormities. In solitude my mind
seemed to recover its force, and many
of the sentiments which I imbibed in
the only tolerable period of my life, returned
with their full force. Still
what should induce me to be the champion
for suffering humanity?&mdash;Who
ever risked any thing for me?&mdash;Who
ever acknowledged me to be a fellow-creature?"&mdash;</p>

<p>Maria took her hand, and Jemima,
more overcome by kindness than she
had ever been by cruelty, hastened out
of the room to conceal her emotions.</p>

<p>Darnford soon after heard his summons,
and, taking leave of him, Maria
promised to gratify his curiosity,
with respect to herself, the first
opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Active</span> as love was in the heart
of Maria, the story she had just heard
made her thoughts take a wider range.
The opening buds of hope closed, as
if they had put forth too early, and the
the happiest day of her life was overcast
by the most melancholy reflections.
Thinking of Jemima's peculiar fate
and her own, she was led to consider
the oppressed state of women, and to
lament that she had given birth to a
daughter. Sleep fled from her eyelids,
while she dwelt on the wretchedness
of unprotected infancy, till sympathy
with Jemima changed to agony,
when it seemed probable that her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-129" id="Pg_1-129"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-129.png">129</a>]</span>
babe might even now be in the very
state she so forcibly described.</p>

<p>Maria thought, and thought again.
Jemima's humanity had rather been
benumbed than killed, by the keen
frost she had to brave at her entrance
into life; an appeal then to her feelings,
on this tender point, surely
would not be fruitless; and Maria began
to anticipate the delight it would
afford her to gain intelligence of her
child. This project was now the only
subject of reflection; and she watched
impatiently for the dawn of day, with
that determinate purpose which generally
insures success.</p>

<p>At the usual hour, Jemima brought
her breakfast, and a tender note from
Darnford. She ran her eye hastily over
it, and her heart calmly hoarded up
the rapture a fresh assurance of affec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-130" id="Pg_1-130"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-130.png">130</a>]</span>tion,
affection such as she wished to
inspire, gave her, without diverting her
mind a moment from its design. While
Jemima waited to take away the
breakfast, Maria alluded to the reflections,
that had haunted her during the
night to the exclusion of sleep. She
spoke with energy of Jemima's unmerited
sufferings, and of the fate of a
number of deserted females, placed
within the sweep of a whirlwind, from
which it was next to impossible to
escape. Perceiving the effect her conversation
produced on the countenance
of her guard, she grasped the arm of
Jemima with that irresistible warmth
which defies repulse, exclaiming&mdash;"With
your heart, and such dreadful
experience, can you lend your aid to
deprive my babe of a mother's tenderness,
a mother's care? In the name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-131" id="Pg_1-131"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-131.png">131</a>]</span>
of God, assist me to snatch her from
destruction! Let me but give her an
education&mdash;let me but prepare her
body and mind to encounter the ills
which await her sex, and I will teach
her to consider you as her second mother,
and herself as the prop of your
age. Yes, Jemima, look at me&mdash;observe
me closely, and read my very soul;
you merit a better fate;" she held out
her hand with a firm gesture of assurance;
"and I will procure it for you,
as a testimony of my esteem, as well as
of my gratitude."</p>

<p>Jemima had not power to resist this
persuasive torrent; and, owning that
the house in which she was confined,
was situated on the banks of the
Thames, only a few miles from London,
and not on the sea-coast, as Darnford
had supposed, she promised to in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-132" id="Pg_1-132"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-132.png">132</a>]</span>vent
some excuse for her absence, and
go herself to trace the situation, and
enquire concerning the health, of this
abandoned daughter. Her manner
implied an intention to do something
more, but she seemed unwilling to
impart her design; and Maria, glad to
have obtained the main point, thought
it best to leave her to the workings of
her own mind; convinced that she had
the power of interesting her still more
in favour of herself and child, by a
simple recital of facts.</p>

<p>In the evening, Jemima informed the
impatient mother, that on the morrow
she should hasten to town before the family
hour of rising, and received all
the information necessary, as a clue to
her search. The "Good night!" Maria
uttered was peculiarly solemn and
affectionate. Glad expectation spar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-133" id="Pg_1-133"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-133.png">133</a>]</span>kled
in her eye; and, for the first time
since her detention, she pronounced
the name of her child with pleasureable
fondness; and, with all the garrulity
of a nurse, described her first
smile when she recognized her mother.
Recollecting herself, a still
kinder "Adieu!" with a "God
bless you!"&mdash;that seemed to include
a maternal benediction, dismissed
Jemima.</p>

<p>The dreary solitude of the ensuing
day, lengthened by impatiently dwelling
on the same idea, was intolerably
wearisome. She listened for the sound
of a particular clock, which some directions
of the wind allowed her to
hear distinctly. She marked the shadow
gaining on the wall; and, twilight
thickening into darkness, her breath
seemed oppressed while she anxiously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-134" id="Pg_1-134"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-134.png">134</a>]</span>
counted nine.&mdash;The last sound was a
stroke of despair on her heart; for she
expected every moment, without seeing
Jemima, to have her light extinguished
by the savage female who supplied
her place. She was even obliged
to prepare for bed, restless as she was,
not to disoblige her new attendant.
She had been cautioned not to speak
too freely to her; but the caution was
needless, her countenance would still
more emphatically have made her
shrink back. Such was the ferocity of
manner, conspicuous in every word
and gesture of this hag, that Maria was
afraid to enquire, why Jemima, who
had faithfully promised to see her before
her door was shut for the night, came
not?&mdash;and, when the key turned in the
lock, to consign her to a night of suspence,
she felt a degree of anguish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-135" id="Pg_1-135"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-135.png">135</a>]</span>
which the circumstances scarcely justified.</p>

<p>Continually on the watch, the shutting
of a door, or the sound of a footstep,
made her start and tremble with
apprehension, something like what she
felt, when, at her entrance, dragged
along the gallery, she began to doubt
whether she were not surrounded by
demons?</p>

<p>Fatigued by an endless rotation of
thought and wild alarms, she looked
like a spectre, when Jemima entered
in the morning; especially as her eyes
darted out of her head, to read in Jemima's
countenance, almost as pallid,
the intelligence she dared not trust her
tongue to demand. Jemima put down
the tea-things, and appeared very busy
in arranging the table. Maria took up
a cup with trembling hand, then for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-136" id="Pg_1-136"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-136.png">136</a>]</span>cibly
recovering her fortitude, and restraining
the convulsive movement
which agitated the muscles of her
mouth, she said, "Spare yourself the
pain of preparing me for your information,
I adjure you!&mdash;My child is dead!"
Jemima solemnly answered, "Yes;"
with a look expressive of compassion
and angry emotions. "Leave me,"
added Maria, making a fresh effort to
govern her feelings, and hiding her face
in her handkerchief, to conceal her anguish&mdash;"It
is enough&mdash;I know that my
babe is no more&mdash;I will hear the particulars
when I am"&mdash;<i>calmer</i>, she could not
utter; and Jemima, without importuning
her by idle attempts to console her,
left the room.</p>

<p>Plunged in the deepest melancholy,
she would not admit Darnford's visits;
and such is the force of early associa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-137" id="Pg_1-137"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-137.png">137</a>]</span>tions
even on strong minds, that, for
a while, she indulged the superstitious
notion that she was justly punished by
the death of her child, for having for an
instant ceased to regret her loss. Two
or three letters from Darnford, full of
soothing, manly tenderness, only added
poignancy to these accusing emotions;
yet the passionate style in which he expressed,
what he termed the first and
fondest wish of his heart, "that his affection
might make her some amends
for the cruelty and injustice she had endured,"
inspired a sentiment of gratitude
to heaven; and her eyes filled
with delicious tears, when, at the conclusion
of his letter, wishing to supply
the place of her unworthy relations,
whose want of principle he execrated,
he assured her, calling her his dearest
girl, "that it should henceforth be the
business of his life to make her happy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-138" id="Pg_1-138"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-138.png">138</a>]</span>
He begged, in a note sent the following
morning, to be permitted to see
her, when his presence would be no intrusion
on her grief; and so earnestly
intreated to be allowed, according to
promise, to beguile the tedious moments
of absence, by dwelling on the
events of her past life, that she sent him
the memoirs which had been written
for her daughter, promising Jemima the
perusal as soon as he returned them.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Addressing</span> these memoirs to
you, my child, uncertain whether I
shall ever have an opportunity of instructing
you, many observations will
probably flow from my heart, which
only a mother&mdash;a mother schooled in
misery, could make.</p>

<p>"The tenderness of a father who knew
the world, might be great; but could it
equal that of a mother&mdash;of a mother,
labouring under a portion of the misery,
which the constitution of society seems

dear girl, you may gather the instruction,
the counsel, which is meant rather
to exercise than influence your
mind.&mdash;Death may snatch me from you,
before you can weigh my advice, or

with fond anxiety, lead you very early
in life to form your grand principle of
action, to save you from the vain regret

spring-tide of existence pass away, unimproved,
unenjoyed.&mdash;Gain experience&mdash;ah!

shrieks, but I would invite all the gay
warblers of spring to nestle in your
blooming bosom.&mdash;Had I not wasted
years in deliberating, after I ceased to
doubt, how I ought to have acted&mdash;I
might now be useful and happy.&mdash;For
my sake, warned by my example, always
appear what you are, and you
will not pass through existence without
enjoying its genuine blessings, love and
respect.</p>

<p>"Born in one of the most romantic
parts of England, an enthusiastic fondness
for the varying charms of nature
is the first sentiment I recollect; or rather
it was the first consciousness of
pleasure that employed and formed my
imagination.</p>

<p>"My father had been a captain
of a man of war; but, disgusted with
the service, on account of the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-142" id="Pg_1-142"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-142.png">142</a>]</span>ferment
of men whose chief merit was
their family connections or borough
interest, he retired into the country;
and, not knowing what to do with
himself&mdash;married. In his family, to
regain his lost consequence, he determined
to keep up the same passive obedience,
as in the vessels in which he had
commanded. His orders were not to be
disputed; and the whole house was expected
to fly, at the word of command,
as if to man the shrouds, or mount aloft
in an elemental strife, big with life or
death. He was to be instantaneously
obeyed, especially by my mother, whom
he very benevolently married for love;
but took care to remind her of the obligation,
when she dared, in the slightest
instance, to question his absolute authority.
My eldest brother, it is true, as
he grew up, was treated with more re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-143" id="Pg_1-143"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-143.png">143</a>]</span>spect
by my father; and became in due
form the deputy-tyrant of the house.
The representative of my father, a being
privileged by nature&mdash;a boy, and
the darling of my mother, he did not
fail to act like an heir apparent. Such
indeed was my mother's extravagant
partiality, that, in comparison with her
affection for him, she might be said not
to love the rest of her children. Yet
none of the children seemed to have so
little affection for her. Extreme indulgence
had rendered him so selfish,
that he only thought of himself; and
from tormenting insects and animals, he
became the despot of his brothers, and
still more of his sisters.</p>

<p>"It is perhaps difficult to give you an
idea of the petty cares which obscured
the morning of my life; continual restraint
in the most trivial matters; un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-144" id="Pg_1-144"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-144.png">144</a>]</span>conditional
submission to orders, which,
as a mere child, I soon discovered to be
unreasonable, because inconsistent and
contradictory. Thus are we destined
to experience a mixture of bitterness,
with the recollection of our most innocent
enjoyments.</p>

<p>"The circumstances which, during
my childhood, occurred to fashion my
mind, were various; yet, as it would
probably afford me more pleasure to
revive the fading remembrance of new-born
delight, than you, my child, could
feel in the perusal, I will not entice
you to stray with me into the verdant
meadow, to search for the flowers that
youthful hopes scatter in every path;
though, as I write, I almost scent the
fresh green of spring&mdash;of that spring
which never returns!</p>

<p>"I had two sisters, and one brother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-145" id="Pg_1-145"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-145.png">145</a>]</span>
younger than myself; my brother Robert
was two years older, and might
truly be termed the idol of his parents,
and the torment of the rest of the family.
Such indeed is the force of prejudice,
that what was called spirit and
wit in him, was cruelly repressed as
forwardness in me.</p>

<p>"My mother had an indolence of
character, which prevented her from
paying much attention to our education.
But the healthy breeze of a
neighbouring heath, on which we
bounded at pleasure, volatilized the
humours that improper food might
have generated. And to enjoy open
air and freedom, was paradise, after
the unnatural restraint of our fire-side,
where we were often obliged to sit
three or four hours together, without
daring to utter a word, when my fa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-146" id="Pg_1-146"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-146.png">146</a>]</span>ther
was out of humour, from want of
employment, or of a variety of boisterous
amusement. I had however one
advantage, an instructor, the brother
of my father, who, intended for the
church, had of course received a
liberal education. But, becoming attached
to a young lady of great beauty
and large fortune, and acquiring in the
world some opinions not consonant
with the profession for which he was
designed, he accepted, with the most
sanguine expectations of success, the
offer of a nobleman to accompany him
to India, as his confidential secretary.</p>

<p>"A correspondence was regularly
kept up with the object of his affection;
and the intricacies of business, peculiarly
wearisome to a man of a romantic
turn of mind, contributed, with a forced
absence, to increase his attachment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-147" id="Pg_1-147"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-147.png">147</a>]</span>
Every other passion was lost in this
master-one, and only served to swell the
torrent. Her relations, such were his
waking dreams, who had despised him,
would court in their turn his alliance,
and all the blandishments of taste would
grace the triumph of love.&mdash;While he
basked in the warm sunshine of love,
friendship also promised to shed its
dewy freshness; for a friend, whom he
loved next to his mistress, was the confident,
who forwarded the letters from
one to the other, to elude the observation
of prying relations. A friend false
in similar circumstances, is, my dearest
girl, an old tale; yet, let not this example,
or the frigid caution of cold-blooded
moralists, make you endeavour
to stifle hopes, which are the buds that
naturally unfold themselves during the
spring of life! Whilst your own heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-148" id="Pg_1-148"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-148.png">148</a>]</span>
is sincere, always expect to meet one
glowing with the same sentiments; for
to fly from pleasure, is not to avoid
pain!</p>

<p>"My uncle realized, by good luck,
rather than management, a handsome
fortune; and returning on the wings of
love, lost in the most enchanting reveries,
to England, to share it with his
mistress and his friend, he found them&mdash;united.</p>

<p>"There were some circumstances, not
necessary for me to recite, which aggravated
the guilt of the friend beyond measure,
and the deception, that had been carried
on to the last moment, was so base,
it produced the most violent effect on
my uncle's health and spirits. His native
country, the world! lately a garden of
blooming sweets, blasted by treachery,
seemed changed into a parched desert,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-149" id="Pg_1-149"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-149.png">149</a>]</span>
the abode of hissing serpents. Disappointment
rankled in his heart; and,
brooding over his wrongs, he was attacked
by a raging fever, followed by
a derangement of mind, which only
gave place to habitual melancholy, as
he recovered more strength of body.</p>

<p>"Declaring an intention never to
marry, his relations were ever clustering
about him, paying the grossest adulation
to a man, who, disgusted with
mankind, received them with scorn, or
bitter sarcasms. Something in my
countenance pleased him, when I began
to prattle. Since his return, he appeared
dead to affection; but I soon,
by showing him innocent fondness, became
a favourite; and endeavouring
to enlarge and strengthen my mind, I
grew dear to him in proportion as I imbibed
his sentiments. He had a forcible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-150" id="Pg_1-150"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-150.png">150</a>]</span>
manner of speaking, rendered more
so by a certain impressive wildness of
look and gesture, calculated to engage
the attention of a young and ardent
mind. It is not then surprising that I
quickly adopted his opinions in preference,
and reverenced him as one of
a superior order of beings. He inculcated,
with great warmth, self-respect,
and a lofty consciousness of acting
right, independent of the censure or
applause of the world; nay, he almost
taught me to brave, and even despise
its censure, when convinced of the rectitude
of my own intentions.</p>

<p>"Endeavouring to prove to me that
nothing which deserved the name of
love or friendship, existed in the world,
he drew such animated pictures of his
own feelings, rendered permanent by
disappointment, as imprinted the sen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-151" id="Pg_1-151"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-151.png">151</a>]</span>timents
strongly on my heart, and animated
my imagination. These remarks
are necessary to elucidate some peculiarities
in my character, which by the
world are indefinitely termed romantic.</p>

<p>"My uncle's increasing affection led
him to visit me often. Still, unable to
rest in any place, he did not remain
long in the country to soften domestic
tyranny; but he brought me books, for
which I had a passion, and they conspired
with his conversation, to make
me form an ideal picture of life. I shall
pass over the tyranny of my father,
much as I suffered from it; but it is
necessary to notice, that it undermined
my mother's health; and that
her temper, continually irritated by
domestic bickering, became intolerably
peevish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-152" id="Pg_1-152"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-152.png">152</a>]</span>
"My eldest brother was articled to a
neighbouring attorney, the shrewdest,
and, I may add, the most unprincipled
man in that part of the country. As
my brother generally came home every
Saturday, to astonish my mother by
exhibiting his attainments, he gradually
assumed a right of directing the
whole family, not excepting my father.
He seemed to take a peculiar pleasure
in tormenting and humbling me; and
if I ever ventured to complain of this
treatment to either my father or mother,
I was rudely rebuffed for presuming
to judge of the conduct of my eldest
brother.</p>

<p>"About this period a merchant's
family came to settle in our neighbourhood.
A mansion-house in the village,
lately purchased, had been preparing
the whole spring, and the sight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-153" id="Pg_1-153"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-153.png">153</a>]</span>
costly furniture, sent from London, had
excited my mother's envy, and roused
my father's pride. My sensations were
very different, and all of a pleasurable
kind. I longed to see new characters,
to break the tedious monotony of my
life; and to find a friend, such as fancy
had pourtrayed. I cannot then describe
the emotion I felt, the Sunday they
made their appearance at church. My
eyes were rivetted on the pillar round
which I expected first to catch a glimpse
of them, and darted forth to meet a
servant who hastily preceded a group
of ladies, whose white robes and waving
plumes, seemed to stream along the
gloomy aisle, diffusing the light, by
which I contemplated their figures.</p>

<p>"We visited them in form; and I
quickly selected the eldest daughter for
my friend. The second son, George,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-154" id="Pg_1-154"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-154.png">154</a>]</span>
paid me particular attention, and finding
his attainments and manners superior
to those of the young men of the
village, I began to imagine him superior
to the rest of mankind. Had my home
been more comfortable, or my previous
acquaintance more numerous, I should
not probably have been so eager to
open my heart to new affections.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables, the merchant, had
acquired a large fortune by unremitting
attention to business; but his health declining
rapidly, he was obliged to retire,
before his son, George, had acquired
sufficient experience, to enable
him to conduct their affairs on the same
prudential plan, his father had invariably
pursued. Indeed, he had laboured
to throw off his authority,
having despised his narrow plans and
cautious speculation. The eldest son<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-155" id="Pg_1-155"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-155.png">155</a>]</span>
could not be prevailed on to enter the
firm; and, to oblige his wife, and have
peace in the house, Mr. Venables had
purchased a commission for him in the
guards.</p>

<p>"I am now alluding to circumstances
which came to my knowledge long
after; but it is necessary, my dearest
child, that you should know the character
of your father, to prevent your
despising your mother; the only parent
inclined to discharge a parent's duty.
In London, George had acquired habits
of libertinism, which he carefully concealed
from his father and his commercial
connections. The mask he
wore, was so complete a covering of
his real visage, that the praise his father
lavished on his conduct, and, poor
mistaken man! on his principles, contrasted
with his brother's, rendered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-156" id="Pg_1-156"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-156.png">156</a>]</span>
notice he took of me peculiarly flattering.
Without any fixed design, as I
am now convinced, he continued to
single me out at the dance, press my
hand at parting, and utter expressions
of unmeaning passion, to which I gave
a meaning naturally suggested by the
romantic turn of my thoughts. His
stay in the country was short; his manners
did not entirely please me; but,
when he left us, the colouring of my
picture became more vivid&mdash;Whither
did not my imagination lead me? In
short, I fancied myself in love&mdash;in love
with the disinterestedness, fortitude,
generosity, dignity, and humanity, with
which I had invested the hero I dubbed.
A circumstance which soon after
occurred, rendered all these virtues
palpable. [The incident is perhaps
worth relating on other accounts, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-157" id="Pg_1-157"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-157.png">157</a>]</span>
therefore I shall describe it distinctly.]</p>

<p>"I had a great affection for my nurse,
old Mary, for whom I used often to
work, to spare her eyes. Mary had a
younger sister, married to a sailor, while
she was suckling me; for my mother
only suckled my eldest brother, which
might be the cause of her extraordinary
partiality. Peggy, Mary's sister, lived
with her, till her husband, becoming a
mate in a West-India trader, got a little
before-hand in the world. He
wrote to his wife from the first port in
the Channel, after his most successful
voyage, to request her to come to
London to meet him; he even wished
her to determine on living there for the
future, to save him the trouble of coming
to her the moment he came on
shore; and to turn a penny by keeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-158" id="Pg_1-158"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-158.png">158</a>]</span>
a green-stall. It was too much to set out
on a journey the moment he had finished
a voyage, and fifty miles by land, was
worse than a thousand leagues by sea.</p>

<p>"She packed up her alls, and came to
London&mdash;but did not meet honest Daniel.
A common misfortune prevented
her, and the poor are bound to suffer
for the good of their country&mdash;he was
pressed in the river&mdash;and never came on
shore.</p>

<p>"Peggy was miserable in London,
not knowing, as she said, 'the face of
any living soul.' Besides, her imagination
had been employed, anticipating
a month or six weeks' happiness with
her husband. Daniel was to have gone
with her to Sadler's Wells, and Westminster
Abbey, and to many sights,
which he knew she never heard of in
the country. Peggy too was thrifty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-159" id="Pg_1-159"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-159.png">159</a>]</span>
and how could she manage to put his
plan in execution alone? He had acquaintance;
but she did not know the
very name of their places of abode.
His letters were made up of&mdash;How do
you does, and God bless yous,&mdash;information
was reserved for the hour of
meeting.</p>

<p>"She too had her portion of information,
near at heart. Molly and Jacky
were grown such little darlings, she
was almost angry that daddy did not
see their tricks. She had not half the
pleasure she should have had from their
prattle, could she have recounted to
him each night the pretty speeches of
the day. Some stories, however, were
stored up&mdash;and Jacky could say papa
with such a sweet voice, it must delight
his heart. Yet when she came, and
found no Daniel to greet her, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-160" id="Pg_1-160"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-160.png">160</a>]</span>
Jacky called papa, she wept, bidding
'God bless his innocent soul, that
did not know what sorrow was.'&mdash;But
more sorrow was in store for Peggy,
innocent as she was.&mdash;Daniel was killed
in the first engagement, and then
the <i>papa</i> was agony, sounding to the
heart.</p>

<p>"She had lived sparingly on his wages,
while there was any hope of his return;
but, that gone, she returned with a
breaking heart to the country, to a
little market town, nearly three miles
from our village. She did not like to
go to service, to be snubbed about,
after being her own mistress. To put
her children out to nurse was impossible:
how far would her wages go? and
to send them to her husband's parish, a
distant one, was to lose her husband
twice over.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-161" id="Pg_1-161"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-161.png">161</a>]</span>
"I had heard all from Mary, and
made my uncle furnish a little cottage
for her, to enable her to sell&mdash;so sacred
was poor Daniel's advice, now he was
dead and gone&mdash;a little fruit, toys and
cakes. The minding of the shop did
not require her whole time, nor even
the keeping her children clean, and
she loved to see them clean; so she took
in washing, and altogether made a shift
to earn bread for her children, still
weeping for Daniel, when Jacky's arch
looks made her think of his father.&mdash;It
was pleasant to work for her children.&mdash;'Yes;
from morning till night,
could she have had a kiss from their
father, God rest his soul! Yes; had
it <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'plased'">pleased</ins> Providence to have let him
come back without a leg or an arm, it
would have been the same thing to her&mdash;for
she did not love him because he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-162" id="Pg_1-162"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-162.png">162</a>]</span>
maintained them&mdash;no; she had hands
of her own.'</p>

<p>"The country people were honest,
and Peggy left her linen out to dry
very late. A recruiting party, as she
supposed, passing through, made free
with a large wash; for it was all swept
away, including her own and her children's
little stock.</p>

<p>"This was a dreadful blow; two dozen
of shirts, stocks and handkerchiefs.
She gave the money which she
had laid by for half a year's rent, and
promised to pay two shillings a week
till all was cleared; so she did not lose
her employment. This two shillings a
week, and the buying a few necessaries
for the children, drove her so hard,
that she had not a penny to pay her rent
with, when a twelvemonth's became
due.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-163" id="Pg_1-163"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-163.png">163</a>]</span>
"She was now with Mary, and had
just told her tale, which Mary instantly
repeated&mdash;it was intended for my
ear. Many houses in this town, producing
a borough-interest, were included
in the estate purchased by Mr.
Venables, and the attorney with whom
my brother lived, was appointed his
agent, to collect and raise the rents.</p>

<p>"He demanded Peggy's, and, in
spite of her intreaties, her poor goods
had been seized and sold. So that she
had not, and what was worse her children,
'for she had known sorrow
enough,' a bed to lie on. She knew
that I was good-natured&mdash;right charitable,
yet not liking to ask for more
than needs must, she scorned to petition
while people could any how be
made to wait. But now, should she
be turned out of doors, she must ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-164" id="Pg_1-164"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-164.png">164</a>]</span>pect
nothing less than to lose all her
customers, and then she must beg or
starve&mdash;and what would become of her
children?&mdash;'had Daniel not been
pressed&mdash;but God knows best&mdash;all this
could not have happened.'</p>

<p>"I had two mattrasses on my bed;
what did I want with two, when
such a worthy creature must lie on the
ground? My mother would be angry,
but I could conceal it till my uncle
came down; and then I would tell him
all the whole truth, and if he absolved
me, heaven would.</p>

<p>"I begged the house-maid to come
up stairs with me (servants always feel
for the distresses of poverty, and so
would the rich if they knew what it
was). She assisted me to tie up the
mattrass; I discovering, at the same
time, that one blanket would serve me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-165" id="Pg_1-165"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-165.png">165</a>]</span>
till winter, could I persuade my sister,
who slept with me, to keep my secret.
She entering in the midst of the package,
I gave her some new feathers, to
silence her. We got the mattrass
down the back stairs, unperceived,
and I helped to carry it, taking with
me all the money I had, and what I
could borrow from my sister.</p>

<p>"When I got to the cottage, Peggy
declared that she would not take what
I had brought secretly; but, when,
with all the eager eloquence inspired
by a decided purpose, I grasped her
hand with weeping eyes, assuring her
that my uncle would screen me from
blame, when he was once more in the
country, describing, at the same time,
what she would suffer in parting with
her children, after keeping them so
long from being thrown on the parish,
she reluctantly consented.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-166" id="Pg_1-166"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-166.png">166</a>]</span>
"My project of usefulness ended not
here; I determined to speak to the
attorney; he frequently paid me compliments.
His character did not intimidate
me; but, imagining that Peggy
must be mistaken, and that no man
could turn a deaf ear to such a tale of
complicated distress, I determined to
walk to the town with Mary the next
morning, and request him to wait for
the rent, and keep my secret, till my
uncle's return.</p>

<p>"My repose was sweet; and, waking
with the first dawn of day, I bounded
to Mary's cottage. What charms do
not a light heart spread over nature!
Every bird that twittered in a bush,
every flower that enlivened the hedge,
seemed placed there to awaken me to
rapture&mdash;yes; to rapture. The present
moment was full fraught with happi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-167" id="Pg_1-167"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-167.png">167</a>]</span>ness;
and on futurity I bestowed not a
thought, excepting to anticipate my
success with the attorney.</p>

<p>"This man of the world, with rosy
face and simpering features, received
me politely, nay kindly; listened with
complacency to my remonstrances,
though he scarcely heeded Mary's tears.
I did not then suspect, that my eloquence
was in my complexion, the
blush of seventeen, or that, in a world
where humanity to women is the characteristic
of advancing civilization, the
beauty of a young girl was so much
more interesting than the distress of an
old one. Pressing my hand, he promised
to let Peggy remain in the house
as long as I wished.&mdash;I more than returned
the pressure&mdash;I was so grateful
and so happy. Emboldened by my innocent
warmth, he then kissed me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-168" id="Pg_1-168"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-168.png">168</a>]</span>&mdash;and
I did not draw back&mdash;I took it for
a kiss of charity.</p>

<p>"Gay as a lark, I went to dine at Mr.
Venables'. I had previously obtained
five shillings from my father, towards
re-clothing the poor children of my
care, and prevailed on my mother to
take one of the girls into the house, whom
I determined to teach to work and read.</p>

<p>"After dinner, when the younger part
of the circle retired to the music room,
I recounted with energy my tale; that
is, I mentioned Peggy's distress, without
hinting at the steps I had taken to
relieve her. Miss Venables gave me
half-a-crown; the heir five shillings;
but George sat unmoved. I was cruelly
distressed by the disappointment&mdash;I
scarcely could remain on my chair;
and, could I have got out of the room
unperceived, I should have flown home,
as if to run away from myself. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-169" id="Pg_1-169"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-169.png">169</a>]</span>
several vain attempts to rise, I leaned
my head against the marble chimney-piece,
and gazing on the evergreens
that filled the fire-place, moralized on
the vanity of human expectations; regardless
of the company. I was roused
by a gentle tap on my shoulder from
behind Charlotte's chair. I turned
my head, and George slid a guinea into
my hand, putting his finger to his
mouth, to enjoin me silence.</p>

<p>"What a revolution took place, not
only in my train of thoughts, but feelings!
I trembled with emotion&mdash;now,
indeed, I was in love. Such delicacy
too, to enhance his benevolence! I felt
in my pocket every five minutes, only
to feel the guinea; and its magic touch
invested my hero with more than mortal
beauty. My fancy had found a basis
to erect its model of perfection on;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-170" id="Pg_1-170"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-170.png">170</a>]</span>
and quickly went to work, with all the
happy credulity of youth, to consider
that heart as devoted to virtue, which
had only obeyed a virtuous impulse.
The bitter experience was yet to come,
that has taught me how very distinct
are the principles of virtue, from the
casual feelings from which they germinate.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_VIII" id="CHAP_VIII"></a>CHAP. VIII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I have</span> perhaps dwelt too long on
a circumstance, which is only of importance
as it marks the progress of a
deception that has been so fatal to my
peace; and introduces to your notice a
poor girl, whom, intending to serve, I led
to ruin. Still it is probable that I was
not entirely the victim of mistake; and
that your father, gradually fashioned
by the world, did not quickly become
what I hesitate to call him&mdash;out of
respect to my daughter.</p>

<p>"But, to hasten to the more busy
scenes of my life. Mr. Venables and
my mother died the same summer;
and, wholly engrossed by my attention
to her, I thought of little else.
The neglect of her darling, my brother
Robert, had a violent effect on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-172" id="Pg_1-172"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-172.png">172</a>]</span>
her weakened mind; for, though boys
may be reckoned the pillars of the
house without doors, girls are often the
only comfort within. They but too frequently
waste their health and spirits
attending a dying parent, who leaves
them in comparative poverty. After
closing, with filial piety, a father's
eyes, they are chased from the paternal
roof, to make room for the first-born,
the son, who is to carry the
empty family-name down to posterity;
though, occupied with his own pleasures,
he scarcely thought of discharging,
in the decline of his parent's life,
the debt contracted in his childhood.
My mother's conduct led me to make
these reflections. Great as was the fatigue
I endured, and the affection my
unceasing solicitude evinced, of which
my mother seemed perfectly sensible,
still, when my brother, whom I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-173" id="Pg_1-173"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-173.png">173</a>]</span>
hardly persuade to remain a quarter of
an hour in her chamber, was with her
alone, a short time before her death,
she gave him a little hoard, which she
had been some years accumulating.</p>

<p>"During my mother's illness, I was
obliged to manage my father's temper,
who, from the lingering nature of her
malady, began to imagine that it was
merely fancy. At this period, an artful
kind of upper servant attracted my
father's attention, and the neighbours
made many remarks on the finery, not
honestly got, exhibited at evening service.
But I was too much occupied
with my mother to observe any change
in her dress or behaviour, or to listen to
the whisper of scandal.</p>

<p>"I shall not dwell on the death-bed
scene, lively as is the remembrance,
or on the emotion produced by the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-174" id="Pg_1-174"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-174.png">174</a>]</span>
grasp of my mother's cold hand; when
blessing me, she added, 'A little patience,
and all will be over!' Ah!
my child, how often have those words
rung mournfully in my ears&mdash;and I
have exclaimed&mdash;'A little more patience,
and I too shall be at rest!'</p>

<p>"My father was violently affected
by her death, recollected instances of
his unkindness, and wept like a child.</p>

<p>"My mother had solemnly recommended
my sisters to my care, and bid
me be a mother to them. They, indeed,
became more dear to me as they
became more forlorn; for, during my
mother's illness, I discovered the ruined
state of my father's circumstances,
and that he had only been able to keep
up appearances, by the sums which he
borrowed of my uncle.</p>

<p>"My father's grief, and consequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-175" id="Pg_1-175"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-175.png">175</a>]</span>
tenderness to his children, quickly
abated, the house grew still more
gloomy or riotous; and my refuge
from care was again at Mr. Venables';
the young 'squire having taken his father's
place, and allowing, for the present,
his sister to preside at his table.
George, though dissatisfied with his
portion of the fortune, which had till
lately been all in trade, visited the family
as usual. He was now full of speculations
in trade, and his brow became
clouded by care. He seemed to relax
in his attention to me, when the presence
of my uncle gave a new turn to
his behaviour. I was too unsuspecting,
too disinterested, to trace these changes
to their source.</p>

<p>My home every day became more
and more disagreeable to me; my liberty
was unnecessarily abridged, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-176" id="Pg_1-176"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-176.png">176</a>]</span>
my books, on the pretext that they made
me idle, taken from me. My father's
mistress was with child, and he, doating
on her, allowed or overlooked her
vulgar manner of tyrannizing over us.
I was indignant, especially when I saw
her endeavouring to attract, shall I
say seduce? my younger brother. By
allowing women but one way of rising
in the world, the fostering the libertinism
of men, society makes monsters
of them, and then their ignoble
vices are brought forward as a proof of
inferiority of intellect.</p>

<p>The wearisomeness of my situation
can scarcely be described. Though my
life had not passed in the most even tenour
with my mother, it was paradise
to that I was destined to endure with
my father's mistress, jealous of her illegitimate
authority. My father's former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-177" id="Pg_1-177"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-177.png">177</a>]</span>
occasional tenderness, in spite of his
violence of temper, had been soothing
to me; but now he only met me with
reproofs or portentous frowns. The
house-keeper, as she was now termed,
was the vulgar despot of the family;
and assuming the new character of a
fine lady, she could never forgive the
contempt which was sometimes visible
in my countenance, when she uttered
with pomposity her bad English, or
affected to be well bred.</p>

<p>To my uncle I ventured to open my
heart; and he, with his wonted benevolence,
began to consider in what
manner he could extricate me out of
my present irksome situation. In spite
of his own disappointment, or, most
probably, actuated by the feelings that
had been petrified, not cooled, in all
their sanguine fervour, like a boiling
torrent of lava suddenly dashing into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-178" id="Pg_1-178"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-178.png">178</a>]</span>
the sea, he thought a marriage of mutual
inclination (would envious stars
permit it) the only chance for happiness
in this disastrous world. George
Venables had the reputation of being
attentive to business, and my father's
example gave great weight to this circumstance;
for habits of order in business
would, he conceived, extend to
the regulation of the affections in domestic
life. George seldom spoke in
my uncle's company, except to utter a
short, judicious question, or to make a
pertinent remark, with all due deference
to his superior judgment; so that
my uncle seldom left his company without
observing, that the young man had
more in him than people supposed.</p>

<p>In this opinion he was not singular;
yet, believe me, and I am not swayed
by resentment, these speeches so justly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-179" id="Pg_1-179"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-179.png">179</a>]</span>
poized, this silent deference, when the
animal spirits of other young people
were throwing off youthful ebullitions,
were not the effect of thought or humility,
but sheer barrenness of mind,
and want of imagination. A colt of
mettle will curvet and shew his paces.
Yes; my dear girl, these prudent
young men want all the fire necessary
to ferment their faculties, and are characterized
as wise, only because they
are not foolish. It is true, that George
was by no means so great a favourite
of mine as during the first year of our
acquaintance; still, as he often coincided
in opinion with me, and echoed
my sentiments; and having myself no
other attachment, I heard with pleasure
my uncle's proposal; but thought
more of obtaining my freedom, than
of my lover. But, when George, seem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-180" id="Pg_1-180"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-180.png">180</a>]</span>ingly
anxious for my happiness, pressed
me to quit my present painful situation,
my heart swelled with gratitude&mdash;I
knew not that my uncle had promised
him five thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Had this truly generous man mentioned
his intention to me, I should have insisted
on a thousand pounds being settled
on each of my sisters; George would
have contested; I should have seen his
selfish soul; and&mdash;gracious God! have
been spared the misery of discovering,
when too late, that I was united to a
heartless, unprincipled wretch. All
my schemes of usefulness would not
then have been blasted. The tenderness
of my heart would not have heated
my imagination with visions of the
ineffable delight of happy love; nor
would the sweet duty of a mother have
been so cruelly interrupted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-181" id="Pg_1-181"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-181.png">181</a>]</span>
But I must not suffer the fortitude
I have so hardly acquired, to be undermined
by unavailing regret. Let me
hasten forward to describe the turbid
stream in which I had to wade&mdash;but
let me exultingly declare that it is
passed&mdash;my soul holds fellowship with
him no more. He cut the Gordian
knot, which my principles, mistaken
ones, respected; he dissolved the tie, the
fetters rather, that ate into my very
vitals&mdash;and I should rejoice, conscious
that my mind is freed, though confined
in hell itself; the only place that even
fancy can imagine more dreadful than
my present abode.</p>

<p>These varying emotions will not allow
me to proceed. I heave sigh after
sigh; yet my heart is still oppressed.
For what am I reserved? Why was I not
born a man, or why was I born at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> public are here pre&#383;ented with
the la&#383;t literary attempt of an author,
who&#383;e fame has been uncommonly exten&#383;ive,
and who&#383;e talents have probably
been mo&#383;t admired, by the per&#383;ons
by whom talents are e&#383;timated
with the greate&#383;t accuracy and di&#383;crimination.
There are few, to whom
her writings could in any ca&#383;e have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-viii_S" id="Pg_1-viii_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
given plea&#383;ure, that would have wi&#383;hed
that this fragment &#383;hould have been
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed, becau&#383;e it is a fragment.
There is a &#383;entiment, very dear to minds
of ta&#383;te and imagination, that finds a
melancholy delight in contemplating
the&#383;e unfini&#383;hed productions of genius,
the&#383;e &#383;ketches of what, if they had
been filled up in a manner adequate to
the writer's conception, would perhaps
have given a new impul&#383;e to the
manners of a world.</p>

<p>The purpo&#383;e and &#383;tructure of the
following work, had long formed a
favourite &#383;ubject of meditation with
its author, and &#383;he judged them capable
of producing an important effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-ix_S" id="Pg_1-ix_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-ix.png">ix</a>]</span>
The compo&#383;ition had been in progre&#383;s
for a period of twelve months. She
was anxious to do ju&#383;tice to her conception,
and recommenced and revi&#383;ed
the manu&#383;cript &#383;everal different times.
So much of it as is here given to the
public, &#383;he was far from con&#383;idering
as fini&#383;hed, and, in a letter to a friend
directly written on this &#383;ubject, &#383;he
&#383;ays, "I am perfectly aware that &#383;ome of
the incidents ought to be tran&#383;po&#383;ed,
and heightened by more harmonious
&#383;hading; and I wi&#383;hed in &#383;ome degree
to avail my&#383;elf of critici&#383;m, before I
began to adju&#383;t my events into a &#383;tory,
the outline of which I had &#383;ketched in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-x_S" id="Pg_1-x_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-x.png">x</a>]</span>
my mind<a name="FNanchor_X-A_1_S" id="FNanchor_X-A_1_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_X-A_1_S" class="fnanchor">[x-A]</a>." The only friends to whom
the author communicated her manu&#383;cript,
were Mr. Dy&#383;on, the tran&#383;lator
of the Sorcerer, and the pre&#383;ent editor;
and it was impo&#383;&#383;ible for the mo&#383;t inexperienced
author to di&#383;play a &#383;tronger
de&#383;ire of profiting by the cen&#383;ures and
&#383;entiments that might be &#383;ugge&#383;ted<a name="FNanchor_X-B_2_S" id="FNanchor_X-B_2_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_X-B_2_S" class="fnanchor">[x-B]</a>.</p>

<p>In revi&#383;ing the&#383;e &#383;heets for the pre&#383;s,
it was nece&#383;&#383;ary for the editor, in &#383;ome
places, to connect the more fini&#383;hed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xi_S" id="Pg_1-xi_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xi.png">xi</a>]</span>
parts with the pages of an older copy,
and a line or two in addition &#383;ometimes
appeared requi&#383;ite for that purpo&#383;e.
Wherever &#383;uch a liberty has been
taken, the additional phra&#383;es will be
found inclo&#383;ed in brackets; it being
the editor's mo&#383;t earne&#383;t de&#383;ire, to
intrude nothing of him&#383;elf into the
work, but to give to the public the
words, as well as ideas, of the real
author.</p>

<p>What follows in the en&#383;uing pages,
is not a preface regularly drawn out
by the author, but merely hints for a
preface, which, though never filled up
in the manner the writer intended,
appeared to be worth pre&#383;erving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Wrongs of Woman, like the
wrongs of the oppre&#383;&#383;ed part of mankind,
may be deemed nece&#383;&#383;ary by
their oppre&#383;&#383;ors: but &#383;urely there are
a few, who will dare to advance before
the improvement of the age, and
grant that my &#383;ketches are not the
abortion of a di&#383;tempered fancy, or
the &#383;trong delineations of a wounded
heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xiv_S" id="Pg_1-xiv_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xiv.png">xiv</a>]</span>In writing this novel, I have rather
endeavoured to pourtray pa&#383;&#383;ions than
manners.</p>

<p>In many in&#383;tances I could have made
the incidents more dramatic, would I
have &#383;acrificed my main object, the
de&#383;ire of exhibiting the mi&#383;ery and
oppre&#383;&#383;ion, peculiar to women, that
ari&#383;e out of the partial laws and cu&#383;toms
of &#383;ociety.</p>

<p>In the invention of the &#383;tory, this
view re&#383;trained my fancy; and the
hi&#383;tory ought rather to be con&#383;idered,
as of woman, than of an individual.</p>

<p>The &#383;entiments I have embodied.</p>

<p>In many works of this &#383;pecies, the
hero is allowed to be mortal, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xv_S" id="Pg_1-xv_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xv.png">xv</a>]</span>
become wi&#383;e and virtuous as well as
happy, by a train of events and circum&#383;tances.
The heroines, on the
contrary, are to be born immaculate;
and to act like godde&#383;&#383;es of wi&#383;dom, ju&#383;t
come forth highly fini&#383;hed Minervas
from the head of Jove.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>[The following is an extract of a
letter from the author to a friend, to
whom &#383;he communicated her manu&#383;cript.]</p>

<hr />

<p>For my part, I cannot &#383;uppo&#383;e any
&#383;ituation more di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ing, than for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xvi_S" id="Pg_1-xvi_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xvi.png">xvi</a>]</span>
woman of &#383;en&#383;ibility, with an improving
mind, to be bound to &#383;uch a man
as I have de&#383;cribed for life; obliged
to renounce all the humanizing affections,
and to avoid cultivating her
ta&#383;te, le&#383;t her perception of grace and
refinement of &#383;entiment, &#383;hould &#383;harpen
to agony the pangs of di&#383;appointment.
Love, in which the imagination
mingles its bewitching colouring,
mu&#383;t be fo&#383;tered by delicacy. I &#383;hould
de&#383;pi&#383;e, or rather call her an ordinary
woman, who could endure &#383;uch a hu&#383;band
as I have &#383;ketched.</p>

<p>The&#383;e appear to me (matrimonial
de&#383;poti&#383;m of heart and conduct) to be
the peculiar Wrongs of Woman, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xvii_S" id="Pg_1-xvii_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-xvii.png">xvii</a>]</span>cau&#383;e
they degrade the mind. What
are termed great mi&#383;fortunes, may
more forcibly impre&#383;s the mind of common
readers; they have more of what
may ju&#383;tly be termed <i>&#383;tage-effect</i>; but
it is the delineation of finer &#383;en&#383;ations,
which, in my opinion, con&#383;titutes the
merit of our be&#383;t novels. This is what
I have in view; and to &#383;how the
wrongs of different cla&#383;&#383;es of women,
equally oppre&#383;&#383;ive, though, from the
difference of education, nece&#383;&#383;arily
various.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abodes</span> of horror have frequently
been de&#383;cribed, and ca&#383;tles, filled with
&#383;pectres and chimeras, conjured up by
the magic &#383;pell of genius to harrow the
&#383;oul, and ab&#383;orb the wondering mind.
But, formed of &#383;uch &#383;tuff as dreams are
made of, what were they to the man&#383;ion
of de&#383;pair, in one corner of which
Maria &#383;at, endeavouring to recal her
&#383;cattered thoughts!</p>

<p>Surpri&#383;e, a&#383;toni&#383;hment, that bordered
on di&#383;traction, &#383;eemed to have &#383;u&#383;pend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-2_S" id="Pg_1-2_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-2.png">2</a>]</span>ed
her faculties, till, waking by degrees
to a keen &#383;en&#383;e of angui&#383;h, a
whirlwind of rage and indignation
rou&#383;ed her torpid pul&#383;e. One recollection
with frightful velocity following
another, threatened to fire her brain,
and make her a fit companion for the
terrific inhabitants, who&#383;e groans and
&#383;hrieks were no un&#383;ub&#383;tantial &#383;ounds of
whi&#383;tling winds, or &#383;tartled birds, modulated
by a romantic fancy, which
amu&#383;e while they affright; but &#383;uch
tones of mi&#383;ery as carry a dreadful certainty
directly to the heart. What
effect mu&#383;t they then have produced on
one, true to the touch of &#383;ympathy, and
tortured by maternal apprehen&#383;ion<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.!'">!</ins></p>

<p>Her infant's image was continually
floating on Maria's &#383;ight, and the fir&#383;t
&#383;mile of intelligence remembered, as
none but a mother, an unhappy mo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-3_S" id="Pg_1-3_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-3.png">3</a>]</span>ther,
can conceive. She heard her half
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads 'speaking half'">&#383;peaking</ins> cooing, and felt the little
twinkling fingers on her burning bo&#383;om&mdash;a
bo&#383;om bur&#383;ting with the nutriment
for which this cheri&#383;hed child
might now be pining in vain. From
a &#383;tranger &#383;he could indeed receive the
maternal aliment, Maria was grieved
at the thought&mdash;but who would watch
her with a mother's tenderne&#383;s, a mother's
&#383;elf-denial?</p>

<p>The retreating &#383;hadows of former
&#383;orrows ru&#383;hed back in a gloomy train,
and &#383;eemed to be pictured on the walls
of her pri&#383;on, magnified by the &#383;tate
of mind in which they were viewed&mdash;Still
&#383;he mourned for her child, lamented
&#383;he was a daughter, and anticipated
the aggravated ills of life that her &#383;ex
rendered almo&#383;t inevitable, even while
dreading &#383;he was no more. To think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-4_S" id="Pg_1-4_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-4.png">4</a>]</span>
that &#383;he was blotted out of exi&#383;tence
was agony, when the imagination had
been long employed to expand her
faculties; yet to &#383;uppo&#383;e her turned
adrift on an unknown &#383;ea, was &#383;carcely
le&#383;s afflicting.</p>

<p>After being two days the prey of impetuous,
varying emotions, Maria began
to reflect more calmly on her pre&#383;ent
&#383;ituation, for &#383;he had actually been rendered
incapable of &#383;ober reflection, by
the di&#383;covery of the act of atrocity of
which &#383;he was the victim. She could
not have imagined, that, in all the fermentation
of civilized depravity, a &#383;imilar
plot could have entered a human
mind. She had been &#383;tunned by an unexpected
blow; yet life, however joyle&#383;s,
was not to be indolently re&#383;igned,
or mi&#383;ery endured without exertion,
and proudly termed patience. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-5_S" id="Pg_1-5_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-5.png">5</a>]</span>
had hitherto meditated only to point
the dart of angui&#383;h, and &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed
the heart heavings of indignant nature
merely by the force of contempt. Now
&#383;he endeavoured to brace her mind to
fortitude, and to a&#383;k her&#383;elf what was
to be her employment in her dreary
cell? Was it not to effect her e&#383;cape,
to fly to the &#383;uccour of her child, and
to baffle the &#383;elfi&#383;h &#383;chemes of her tyrant&mdash;her
hu&#383;band?</p>

<p>The&#383;e thoughts rou&#383;ed her &#383;leeping
&#383;pirit, and the &#383;elf-po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion returned,
that &#383;eemed to have abandoned her in
the infernal &#383;olitude into which &#383;he
had been precipitated. The fir&#383;t emotions
of overwhelming impatience began
to &#383;ub&#383;ide, and re&#383;entment gave
place to tenderne&#383;s, and more tranquil
meditation; though anger once more
&#383;topt the calm current of reflection<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.'">,</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-6_S" id="Pg_1-6_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-6.png">6</a>]</span>
when &#383;he attempted to move her manacled
arms. But this was an outrage
that could only excite momentary feelings
of &#383;corn, which evaporated in a
faint &#383;mile; for Maria was far from
thinking a per&#383;onal in&#383;ult the mo&#383;t difficult
to endure with magnanimous indifference.</p>

<p>She approached the &#383;mall grated
window of her chamber, and for a
con&#383;iderable time only regarded the
blue expan&#383;e; though it commanded
a view of a de&#383;olate garden, and of
part of a huge pile of buildings, that,
after having been &#383;uffered, for half a
century, to fall to decay, had undergone
&#383;ome clum&#383;y repairs, merely to
render it habitable. The ivy had been
torn off the turrets, and the &#383;tones not
wanted to patch up the breaches of
time, and exclude the warring ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-7_S" id="Pg_1-7_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-7.png">7</a>]</span>ments,
left in heaps in the di&#383;ordered
court. Maria contemplated this &#383;cene
&#383;he knew not how long; or rather
gazed on the walls, and pondered on
her &#383;ituation. To the ma&#383;ter of this
mo&#383;t horrid of pri&#383;ons, &#383;he had, &#383;oon
after her entrance, raved of inju&#383;tice,
in accents that would have ju&#383;tified
his treatment, had not a malignant
&#383;mile, when &#383;he appealed to his judgment,
with a dreadful conviction &#383;tifled
her remon&#383;trating complaints. By
force, or openly, what could be done?
But &#383;urely &#383;ome expedient might occur
to an active mind, without any other
employment, and po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of &#383;ufficient
re&#383;olution to put the ri&#383;k of life into
the balance with the chance of freedom.</p>

<p>A woman entered in the mid&#383;t of
the&#383;e reflections, with a firm, deliberate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-8_S" id="Pg_1-8_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-8.png">8</a>]</span>
&#383;tep, &#383;trongly marked features, and
large black eyes, which &#383;he fixed
&#383;teadily on Maria's, as if &#383;he de&#383;igned
to intimidate her, &#383;aying at the &#383;ame
time&mdash;"You had better &#383;it down and
eat your dinner, than look at the
clouds."</p>

<p>"I have no appetite," replied Maria,
who had previou&#383;ly determined to
&#383;peak mildly, "why then &#383;hould I
eat?"</p>

<p>"But, in &#383;pite of that, you mu&#383;t
and &#383;hall eat &#383;omething. I have had
many ladies under my care, who have
re&#383;olved to &#383;tarve them&#383;elves; but, &#383;oon
or late, they gave up their intent, as
they recovered their &#383;en&#383;es."</p>

<p>"Do you really think me mad?"
a&#383;ked Maria, meeting the &#383;earching
glance of her eye.</p>

<p>"Not ju&#383;t now. But what does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-9_S" id="Pg_1-9_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-9.png">9</a>]</span>
that prove?&mdash;only that you mu&#383;t be
the more carefully watched, for appearing
at times &#383;o rea&#383;onable. You
have not touched a mor&#383;el &#383;ince you
entered the hou&#383;e."&mdash;Maria &#383;ighed intelligibly.&mdash;"Could
any thing but madne&#383;s
produce &#383;uch a di&#383;gu&#383;t for food?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grief; you would not a&#383;k
the que&#383;tion if you knew what it
was." The attendant &#383;hook her head;
and a gha&#383;tly &#383;mile of de&#383;perate fortitude
&#383;erved as a forcible reply, and
made Maria pau&#383;e, before &#383;he added&mdash;"Yet
I will take &#383;ome refre&#383;hment:
I mean not to die.&mdash;No; I will pre&#383;erve
my &#383;en&#383;es; and convince even
you, &#383;ooner than you are aware of,
that my intellects have never been di&#383;turbed,
though the exertion of them

drug."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-10_S" id="Pg_1-10_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-10.png">10</a>]</span>
Doubt gathered &#383;till thicker on the
brow of her guard, as &#383;he attempted
to convict her of mi&#383;take.</p>

<p>"Have patience!" exclaimed Maria,
with a &#383;olemnity that in&#383;pired awe.
"My God! how have I been &#383;chooled
into the practice!" A &#383;uffocation of
voice betrayed the agonizing emotions
&#383;he was labouring to keep down; and
conquering a qualm of di&#383;gu&#383;t, &#383;he
calmly endeavoured to eat enough to
prove her docility, perpetually turning
to the &#383;u&#383;picious female, who&#383;e ob&#383;ervation
&#383;he courted, while &#383;he was
making the bed and adju&#383;ting the
room.</p>

<p>"Come to me often," &#383;aid Maria,
with a tone of per&#383;ua&#383;ion, in con&#383;equence
of a vague plan that &#383;he had
ha&#383;tily adopted, when, after &#383;urveying
this woman's form and features, &#383;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-11_S" id="Pg_1-11_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-11.png">11</a>]</span>
felt convinced that &#383;he had an under&#383;tanding
above the common &#383;tandard;
"and believe me mad, till you are
obliged to acknowledge the contrary."
The woman was no fool, that is, &#383;he
was &#383;uperior to her cla&#383;s; nor had
mi&#383;ery quite petrified the life's-blood
of humanity, to which reflections on
our own mi&#383;fortunes only give a more
orderly cour&#383;e. The manner, rather
than the expo&#383;tulations, of Maria
made a &#383;light &#383;u&#383;picion dart into her
mind with corre&#383;ponding &#383;ympathy,
which various other avocations, and
the habit of bani&#383;hing compunction,
prevented her, for the pre&#383;ent, from
examining more minutely.</p>

<p>But when &#383;he was told that no per&#383;on,
excepting the phy&#383;ician appointed by
her family, was to be permitted to &#383;ee
the lady at the end of the gallery, &#383;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-12_S" id="Pg_1-12_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-12.png">12</a>]</span>
opened her keen eyes &#383;till wider, and
uttered a&mdash;"hem!" before &#383;he enquired&mdash;"Why?"
She was briefly told, in
reply, that the malady was hereditary,
and the fits not occurring but at very
long and irregular intervals, &#383;he mu&#383;t
be carefully watched; for the length of
the&#383;e lucid periods only rendered her
more mi&#383;chievous, when any vexation
or caprice brought on the paroxy&#383;m of
phren&#383;y.</p>

<p>Had her ma&#383;ter tru&#383;ted her, it is
probable that neither pity nor curio&#383;ity
would have made her &#383;werve from the
&#383;traight line of her intere&#383;t; for &#383;he
had &#383;uffered too much in her intercour&#383;e
with mankind, not to determine
to look for &#383;upport, rather to humouring
their pa&#383;&#383;ions, than courting
their approbation by the integrity of
her conduct. A deadly blight had met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-13_S" id="Pg_1-13_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-13.png">13</a>]</span>
her at the very thre&#383;hold of exi&#383;tence;
and the wretchedne&#383;s of her mother
&#383;eemed a heavy weight fa&#383;tened on her
innocent neck, to drag her down to
perdition. She could not heroically
determine to &#383;uccour an unfortunate;
but, offended at the bare &#383;uppo&#383;ition
that &#383;he could be deceived with the
&#383;ame ea&#383;e as a common &#383;ervant, &#383;he
no longer curbed her curio&#383;ity; and,
though &#383;he never &#383;eriou&#383;ly fathomed
her own intentions, &#383;he would &#383;it, every
moment &#383;he could &#383;teal from ob&#383;ervation,
li&#383;tening to the tale, which Maria
was eager to relate with all the per&#383;ua&#383;ive
eloquence of grief.</p>

<p>It is &#383;o cheering to &#383;ee a human
face, even if little of the divinity of
virtue beam in it, that Maria anxiou&#383;ly
expected the return of the attendant,
as of a gleam of light to break the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-14_S" id="Pg_1-14_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-14.png">14</a>]</span>
gloom of idlene&#383;s. Indulged &#383;orrow;
&#383;he perceived, mu&#383;t blunt or &#383;harpen
the faculties to the two oppo&#383;ite extremes;
producing &#383;tupidity, the moping
melancholy of indolence; or the
re&#383;tle&#383;s activity of a di&#383;turbed imagination.
She &#383;unk into one &#383;tate, after
being fatigued by the other: till the
want of occupation became even more
painful than the actual pre&#383;&#383;ure or apprehen&#383;ion
of &#383;orrow; and the confinement
that froze her into a nook of
exi&#383;tence, with an unvaried pro&#383;pect
before her, the mo&#383;t in&#383;upportable of
evils. The lamp of life &#383;eemed to be
&#383;pending it&#383;elf to cha&#383;e the vapours of
a dungeon which no art could di&#383;&#383;ipate.&mdash;And
to what purpo&#383;e did &#383;he
rally all her energy?&mdash;Was not the
world a va&#383;t pri&#383;on, and women born
&#383;laves?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-15_S" id="Pg_1-15_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-15.png">15</a>]</span>
Though &#383;he failed immediately to
rou&#383;e a lively &#383;en&#383;e of inju&#383;tice in the
mind of her guard, becau&#383;e it had
been &#383;ophi&#383;ticated into mi&#383;anthropy,
&#383;he touched her heart. Jemima (&#383;he
had only a claim to a Chri&#383;tian name,
which had not procured her any Chri&#383;tian
privileges) could patiently hear of
Maria's confinement on fal&#383;e pretences;
&#383;he had felt the cru&#383;hing hand of
power, hardened by the exerci&#383;e of
inju&#383;tice, and cea&#383;ed to wonder at the
perver&#383;ions of the under&#383;tanding, which
&#383;y&#383;tematize oppre&#383;&#383;ion; but, when told
that her child, only four months old,
had been torn from her, even while
&#383;he was di&#383;charging the tendere&#383;t maternal
office, the woman awoke in a
bo&#383;om long e&#383;tranged from feminine
emotions, and Jemima determined to
alleviate all in her power, without ha<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-16_S" id="Pg_1-16_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-16.png">16</a>]</span>zarding
the lo&#383;s of her place, the &#383;ufferings
of a wretched mother, apparently
injured, and certainly unhappy.
A &#383;en&#383;e of right &#383;eems to re&#383;ult from
the &#383;imple&#383;t act of rea&#383;on, and to pre&#383;ide
over the faculties of the mind,
like the ma&#383;ter-&#383;en&#383;e of feeling, to
rectify the re&#383;t; but (for the compari&#383;on
may be carried &#383;till farther) how
often is the exqui&#383;ite &#383;en&#383;ibility of
both weakened or de&#383;troyed by the
vulgar occupations, and ignoble plea&#383;ures
of life?</p>

<p>The pre&#383;erving her &#383;ituation was,
indeed, an important object to Jemima,
who had been hunted from hole
to hole, as if &#383;he had been a bea&#383;t of
prey, or infected with a moral plague.
The wages &#383;he received, the greater
part of which &#383;he hoarded, as her only
chance for independence, were much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-17_S" id="Pg_1-17_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-17.png">17</a>]</span>
more con&#383;iderable than &#383;he could reckon
on obtaining any where el&#383;e, were
it po&#383;&#383;ible that &#383;he, an outca&#383;t from
&#383;ociety, could be permitted to earn a
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence in a reputable family. Hearing
Maria perpetually complain of li&#383;tle&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s,
and the not being able to beguile
grief by re&#383;uming her cu&#383;tomary
pur&#383;uits, &#383;he was ea&#383;ily prevailed on,
by compa&#383;&#383;ion, and that involuntary
re&#383;pect for abilities, which tho&#383;e who
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s them can never eradicate, to
bring her &#383;ome books and implements
for writing. Maria's conver&#383;ation had
amu&#383;ed and intere&#383;ted her, and the natural
con&#383;equence was a de&#383;ire, &#383;carcely
ob&#383;erved by her&#383;elf, of obtaining the
e&#383;teem of a per&#383;on &#383;he admired. The
remembrance of better days was rendered
more lively; and the &#383;entiments
then acquired appearing le&#383;s romantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-18_S" id="Pg_1-18_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-18.png">18</a>]</span>
than they had for a long period, a
&#383;park of hope rou&#383;ed her mind to new
activity.</p>

<p>How grateful was her attention to
Maria! Oppre&#383;&#383;ed by a dead weight
of exi&#383;tence, or preyed on by the
gnawing worm of di&#383;content, with
what eagerne&#383;s did &#383;he endeavour to
&#383;horten the long days, which left no
traces behind! She &#383;eemed to be
&#383;ailing on the va&#383;t ocean of life, without
&#383;eeing any land-mark to indicate
the progre&#383;s of time; to find employment
was then to find variety, the
animating principle of nature.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II_S" id="CHAP_II_S"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Earne&#383;tly</span> as Maria endeavoured
to &#383;oothe, by reading, the angui&#383;h
of her wounded mind, her thoughts
would often wander from the &#383;ubject
&#383;he was led to di&#383;cu&#383;s, and tears of
maternal tenderne&#383;s ob&#383;cured the rea&#383;oning
page. She de&#383;canted on "the
ills which fle&#383;h is heir to," with bitterne&#383;s,
when the recollection of her
babe was revived by a tale of fictitious
woe, that bore any re&#383;emblance to her
own; and her imagination was continually
employed, to conjure up and
embody the various phantoms of mi&#383;ery,
which folly and vice had let loo&#383;e
on the world. The lo&#383;s of her babe
was the tender &#383;tring; again&#383;t other
cruel remembrances &#383;he laboured to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-20_S" id="Pg_1-20_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-20.png">20</a>]</span>
&#383;teel her bo&#383;om; and even a ray of
hope, in the mid&#383;t of her gloomy reveries,
would &#383;ometimes gleam on the
dark horizon of futurity, while per&#383;uading
her&#383;elf that &#383;he ought to cea&#383;e
to hope, &#383;ince happine&#383;s was no where
to be found.&mdash;But of her child, debilitated
by the grief with which its
mother had been a&#383;&#383;ailed before it &#383;aw
the light, &#383;he could not think without
an impatient &#383;truggle.</p>

<p>"I, alone, by my active tenderne&#383;s,
could have &#383;aved," &#383;he would exclaim,
"from an early blight, this &#383;weet
blo&#383;&#383;om; and, cheri&#383;hing it, I &#383;hould
have had &#383;omething &#383;till to love."</p>

<p>In proportion as other expectations
were torn from her, this tender one
had been fondly clung to, and knit
into her heart.</p>

<p>The books &#383;he had obtained, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-21_S" id="Pg_1-21_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-21.png">21</a>]</span>
&#383;oon devoured, by one who had no
other re&#383;ource to e&#383;cape from &#383;orrow,
and the feveri&#383;h dreams of ideal wretchedne&#383;s
or felicity, which equally weaken
the intoxicated &#383;en&#383;ibility. Writing
was then the only alternative, and
&#383;he wrote &#383;ome rhap&#383;odies de&#383;criptive
of the &#383;tate of her mind; but the
events of her pa&#383;t life pre&#383;&#383;ing on her,
&#383;he re&#383;olved circum&#383;tantially to relate
them, with the &#383;entiments that experience,
and more matured rea&#383;on,
would naturally &#383;ugge&#383;t. They might
perhaps in&#383;truct her daughter, and
&#383;hield her from the mi&#383;ery, the tyranny,
her mother knew not how to avoid.</p>

<p>This thought gave life to her diction,
her &#383;oul flowed into it, and &#383;he &#383;oon
found the ta&#383;k of recollecting almo&#383;t
obliterated impre&#383;&#383;ions very intere&#383;ting.
She lived again in the revived emo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-22_S" id="Pg_1-22_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-22.png">22</a>]</span>tions
of youth, and forgot her pre&#383;ent
in the retro&#383;pect of &#383;orrows that had
a&#383;&#383;umed an unalterable character.</p>

<p>Though this employment lightened
the weight of time, yet, never lo&#383;ing
&#383;ight of her main object, Maria did
not allow any opportunity to &#383;lip of
winning on the affections of Jemima;
for &#383;he di&#383;covered in her a &#383;trength of
mind, that excited her e&#383;teem, clouded
as it was by the mi&#383;anthropy of de&#383;pair.</p>

<p>An in&#383;ulated being, from the mi&#383;fortune
of her birth, &#383;he de&#383;pi&#383;ed and
preyed on the &#383;ociety by which &#383;he
had been oppre&#383;&#383;ed, and loved not her
fellow-creatures, becau&#383;e &#383;he had never
been beloved. No mother had ever
fondled her, no father or brother had
protected her from outrage; and the
man who had plunged her into in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-23_S" id="Pg_1-23_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-23.png">23</a>]</span>famy,
and de&#383;erted her when &#383;he &#383;tood
in greate&#383;t need of &#383;upport, deigned
not to &#383;mooth with kindne&#383;s the road
to ruin. Thus degraded, was &#383;he let
loo&#383;e on the world; and virtue, never
nurtured by affection, a&#383;&#383;umed the &#383;tern
a&#383;pect of &#383;elfi&#383;h independence.</p>

<p>This general view of her life, Maria
gathered from her exclamations and
dry remarks. Jemima indeed di&#383;played
a &#383;trange mixture of intere&#383;t
and &#383;u&#383;picion; for &#383;he would li&#383;ten to
her with earne&#383;tne&#383;s, and then &#383;uddenly
interrupt the conver&#383;ation, as if
afraid of re&#383;igning, by giving way to
her &#383;ympathy, her dear-bought knowledge
of the world.</p>

<p>Maria alluded to the po&#383;&#383;ibility of
an e&#383;cape, and mentioned a compen&#383;ation,
or reward; but the &#383;tyle in which
&#383;he was repul&#383;ed made her cautious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-24_S" id="Pg_1-24_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-24.png">24</a>]</span>
and determine not to renew the &#383;ubject,
till &#383;he knew more of the character
&#383;he had to work on. Jemima's
countenance, and dark hints, &#383;eemed
to &#383;ay, "You are an extraordinary
woman; but let me con&#383;ider, this may
only be one of your lucid intervals."
Nay, the very energy of Maria's character,
made her &#383;u&#383;pect that the extraordinary
animation &#383;he perceived
might be the effect of madne&#383;s. "Should
her hu&#383;band then &#383;ub&#383;tantiate his
charge, and get po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of her e&#383;tate,
from whence would come the promi&#383;ed
annuity, or more de&#383;ired protection?
Be&#383;ides, might not a woman, anxious
to e&#383;cape, conceal &#383;ome of the circum&#383;tances
which made again&#383;t her? Was
truth to be expected from one who
had been entrapped, kidnapped, in
the mo&#383;t fraudulent manner?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-25_S" id="Pg_1-25_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-25.png">25</a>]</span>
In this train Jemima continued to
argue, the moment after compa&#383;&#383;ion
and re&#383;pect &#383;eemed to make her &#383;werve;
and &#383;he &#383;till re&#383;olved not to be wrought
on to do more than &#383;often the rigour
of confinement, till &#383;he could advance
on &#383;urer ground.</p>

<p>Maria was not permitted to walk in
the garden; but &#383;ometimes, from her
window, &#383;he turned her eyes from the
gloomy walls, in which &#383;he pined life
away, on the poor wretches who &#383;trayed
along the walks, and contemplated
the mo&#383;t terrific of ruins&mdash;that of a
human &#383;oul. What is the view of the
fallen column, the mouldering arch, of
the mo&#383;t exqui&#383;ite workman&#383;hip, when
compared with this living memento of
the fragility, the in&#383;tability, of rea&#383;on,
and the wild luxuriancy of noxious
pa&#383;&#383;ions? Enthu&#383;ia&#383;m turned adrift,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-26_S" id="Pg_1-26_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-26.png">26</a>]</span>
like &#383;ome rich &#383;tream overflowing its
banks, ru&#383;hes forward with de&#383;tructive
velocity, in&#383;piring a &#383;ublime concentration
of thought. Thus thought
Maria&mdash;The&#383;e are the ravages over
which humanity mu&#383;t ever mournfully
ponder, with a degree of angui&#383;h not
excited by crumbling marble, or cankering
bra&#383;s, unfaithful to the tru&#383;t of
monumental fame. It is not over the
decaying productions of the mind, embodied
with the happie&#383;t art, we grieve
mo&#383;t bitterly. The view of what has
been done by man, produces a melancholy,
yet aggrandizing, &#383;en&#383;e of what
remains to be achieved by human intellect;
but a mental convul&#383;ion, which,
like the deva&#383;tation of an earthquake,
throws all the elements of thought and
imagination into confu&#383;ion, makes con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-27_S" id="Pg_1-27_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-27.png">27</a>]</span>templation
giddy, and we fearfully a&#383;k
on what ground we our&#383;elves &#383;tand.</p>

<p>Melancholy and imbecility marked
the features of the wretches allowed to
breathe at large; for the frantic, tho&#383;e
who in a &#383;trong imagination had lo&#383;t a
&#383;en&#383;e of woe, were clo&#383;ely confined.
The playful tricks and mi&#383;chievous devices
of their di&#383;turbed fancy, that &#383;uddenly
broke out, could not be guarded
again&#383;t, when they were permitted to
enjoy any portion of freedom; for,
&#383;o active was their imagination, that
every new object which accidentally
&#383;truck their &#383;en&#383;es, awoke to phrenzy
their re&#383;tle&#383;s pa&#383;&#383;ions; as Maria learned
from the burden of their ince&#383;&#383;ant
ravings.</p>

<p>Sometimes, with a &#383;trict injunction
of &#383;ilence, Jemima would allow Maria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-28_S" id="Pg_1-28_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-28.png">28</a>]</span>
at the clo&#383;e of evening, to &#383;tray along
the narrow avenues that &#383;eparated the
dungeon-like apartments, leaning on
her arm. What a change of &#383;cene!
Maria wi&#383;hed to pa&#383;s the thre&#383;hold of
her pri&#383;on, yet, when by chance &#383;he
met the eye of rage glaring on her, yet
unfaithful to its office, &#383;he &#383;hrunk back
with more horror and affright, than if
&#383;he had &#383;tumbled over a mangled corp&#383;e.
Her bu&#383;y fancy pictured the mi&#383;ery of a
fond heart, watching over a friend thus
e&#383;tranged, ab&#383;ent, though pre&#383;ent&mdash;over
a poor wretch lo&#383;t to rea&#383;on and the
&#383;ocial joys of exi&#383;tence; and lo&#383;ing all
con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of mi&#383;ery in its exce&#383;s.
What a ta&#383;k, to watch the light of rea&#383;on
quivering in the eye, or with agonizing
expectation to catch the beam of recollection;
tantalized by hope, only to
feel de&#383;pair more keenly, at finding a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-29_S" id="Pg_1-29_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-29.png">29</a>]</span>
much loved face or voice, &#383;uddenly remembered,

only to be immediately forgotten, or
viewed with indifference or abhorrence!</p>

<p>The heart-rending &#383;igh of melancholy
&#383;unk into her &#383;oul; and when &#383;he retired
to re&#383;t, the petrified figures &#383;he
had encountered, the only human forms
&#383;he was doomed to ob&#383;erve, haunting
her dreams with tales of my&#383;terious
wrongs, made her wi&#383;h to &#383;leep to dream
no more.</p>

<p>Day after day rolled away, and tedious
as the pre&#383;ent moment appeared,
they pa&#383;&#383;ed in &#383;uch an unvaried tenor,
Maria was &#383;urpri&#383;ed to find that &#383;he
had already been &#383;ix weeks buried alive,
and yet had &#383;uch faint hopes of effecting
her enlargement. She was, earne&#383;tly
as &#383;he had &#383;ought for employment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-30_S" id="Pg_1-30_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-30.png">30</a>]</span>
now angry with her&#383;elf for having been
amu&#383;ed by writing her narrative; and
grieved to think that &#383;he had for an in&#383;tant
thought of any thing, but contriving
to e&#383;cape.</p>

<p>Jemima had evidently plea&#383;ure in
her &#383;ociety: &#383;till, though &#383;he often left
her with a glow of kindne&#383;s, &#383;he returned
with the &#383;ame chilling air; and,
when her heart appeared for a moment
to open, &#383;ome &#383;ugge&#383;tion of rea&#383;on forcibly
clo&#383;ed it, before &#383;he could give
utterance to the confidence Maria's
conver&#383;ation in&#383;pired.</p>

<p>Di&#383;couraged by the&#383;e changes, Maria
relap&#383;ed into de&#383;pondency, when &#383;he
was cheered by the alacrity with which
Jemima brought her a fre&#383;h parcel of
books; a&#383;&#383;uring her, that &#383;he had taken
&#383;ome pains to obtain them from one of
the keepers, who attended a gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-31_S" id="Pg_1-31_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-31.png">31</a>]</span>man
confined in the oppo&#383;ite corner of
the gallery.</p>

<p>Maria took up the books with emotion.
"They come," &#383;aid &#383;he, "perhaps,
from a wretch condemned, like
me, to rea&#383;on on the nature of madne&#383;s,
by having wrecked minds continually
under his eye; and almo&#383;t to wi&#383;h him&#383;elf&mdash;as
I do&mdash;mad, to e&#383;cape from the
contemplation of it." Her heart throbbed
with &#383;ympathetic alarm; and &#383;he
turned over the leaves with awe, as if
they had become &#383;acred from pa&#383;&#383;ing
through the hands of an unfortunate
being, oppre&#383;&#383;ed by a &#383;imilar fate.</p>

<p>Dryden's Fables, Milton's Paradi&#383;e
Lo&#383;t, with &#383;everal modern productions,
compo&#383;ed the collection. It was a
mine of trea&#383;ure. Some marginal notes,
in Dryden's Fables, caught her attention:
they were written with force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-32_S" id="Pg_1-32_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-32.png">32</a>]</span>
and ta&#383;te; and, in one of the modern
pamphlets, there was a fragment left,
containing various ob&#383;ervations on the
pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of &#383;ociety and government,
with a comparative view of the
politics of Europe and America. The&#383;e
remarks were written with a degree of
generous warmth, when alluding to the
en&#383;laved &#383;tate of the labouring majority,
perfectly in uni&#383;on with Maria's mode
of thinking.</p>

<p>She read them over and over again;
and fancy, treacherous fancy, began to
&#383;ketch a character, congenial with her
own, from the&#383;e &#383;hadowy outlines.&mdash;"Was
he mad?" She re-peru&#383;ed the
marginal notes, and they &#383;eemed the
production of an animated, but not of a
di&#383;turbed imagination. Confined to
this &#383;peculation, every time &#383;he re-read
them, &#383;ome fre&#383;h refinement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-33_S" id="Pg_1-33_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-33.png">33</a>]</span>
&#383;entiment, or <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'accutene&#383;s'">acutene&#383;s</ins> of thought
impre&#383;&#383;ed her, which &#383;he was a&#383;toni&#383;hed
at her&#383;elf for not having before ob&#383;erved.</p>

<p>What a creative power has an affectionate
heart! There are beings who
cannot live without loving, as poets
love; and who feel the electric &#383;park
of genius, wherever it awakens &#383;entiment
or grace. Maria had often thought,
when di&#383;ciplining her wayward heart,
"that to charm, was to be virtuous."
"They who make me wi&#383;h to appear
the mo&#383;t amiable and good in their eyes,
mu&#383;t po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s in a degree," &#383;he would
exclaim, "the graces and virtues they
call into action."</p>

<p>She took up a book on the powers of
the human mind; but, her attention
&#383;trayed from cold arguments on the
nature of what &#383;he felt, while &#383;he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-34_S" id="Pg_1-34_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-34.png">34</a>]</span>
feeling, and &#383;he &#383;napt the chain of the
theory to read Dryden's Gui&#383;card and
Sigi&#383;munda.</p>

<p>Maria, in the cour&#383;e of the en&#383;uing
day, returned &#383;ome of the books, with
the hope of getting others&mdash;and more
marginal notes. Thus &#383;hut out from
human intercour&#383;e, and compelled to
view nothing but the pri&#383;on of vexed
&#383;pirits, to meet a wretch in the &#383;ame
&#383;ituation, was more &#383;urely to find a
friend, than to imagine a countryman
one, in a &#383;trange land, where the human
voice conveys no information to
the eager ear.</p>

<p>"Did you ever &#383;ee the unfortunate
being to whom the&#383;e books belong?"
a&#383;ked Maria, when Jemima brought
her &#383;upper. "Yes. He &#383;ometimes
walks out, between five and &#383;ix, before
the family is &#383;tirring, in the morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-35_S" id="Pg_1-35_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-35.png">35</a>]</span>
with two keepers; but even then his
hands are confined."</p>

<p>"What! is he &#383;o unruly?" enquired
Maria, with an accent of di&#383;appointment.</p>

<p>"No, not that I perceive," replied
Jemima; "but he has an untamed
look, a vehemence of eye, that excites
apprehen&#383;ion. Were his hands free,
he looks as if he could &#383;oon manage
both his guards: yet he appears
tranquil."</p>

<p>"If he be &#383;o &#383;trong, he mu&#383;t be
young," ob&#383;erved Maria.</p>

<p>"Three or four and thirty, I &#383;uppo&#383;e;
but there is no judging of a
per&#383;on in his &#383;ituation."</p>

<p>"Are you &#383;ure that he is mad?"
interrupted Maria with eagerne&#383;s. Jemima
quitted the room, without replying.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-36_S" id="Pg_1-36_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-36.png">36</a>]</span>
"No, no, he certainly is not!" exclaimed
Maria, an&#383;wering her&#383;elf;
"the man who could write tho&#383;e ob&#383;ervations
was not di&#383;ordered in his
intellects."</p>

<p>She &#383;at mu&#383;ing, gazing at the moon,
and watching its motion as it &#383;eemed
to glide under the clouds. Then, preparing
for bed, &#383;he thought, "Of
what u&#383;e could I be to him, or he to
me, if it be true that he is unju&#383;tly
confined?&mdash;Could he aid me to e&#383;cape,
who is him&#383;elf more clo&#383;ely watched?&mdash;Still
I &#383;hould like to &#383;ee him." She
went to bed, dreamed of her child,
yet woke exactly at half after five
o'clock, and &#383;tarting up, only wrapped
a gown around her, and ran to the
window. The morning was chill, it
was the latter end of September; yet
&#383;he did not retire to warm her&#383;elf and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-37_S" id="Pg_1-37_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-37.png">37</a>]</span>
think in bed, till the &#383;ound of the
&#383;ervants, moving about the hou&#383;e, convinced
her that the unknown would
not walk in the garden that morning.
She was a&#383;hamed at feeling di&#383;appointed;
and began to reflect, as an excu&#383;e
to her&#383;elf, on the little objects which
attract attention when there is nothing
to divert the mind; and how difficult
it was for women to avoid growing
romantic, who have no active duties
or pur&#383;uits.</p>

<p>At breakfa&#383;t, Jemima enquired whether
&#383;he under&#383;tood French? for, unle&#383;s
&#383;he did, the &#383;tranger's &#383;tock of
books was exhau&#383;ted. Maria replied
in the affirmative; but forbore to a&#383;k
any more que&#383;tions re&#383;pecting the per&#383;on
to whom they belonged. And Jemima
gave her a new &#383;ubject for contemplation,
by de&#383;cribing the per&#383;on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-38_S" id="Pg_1-38_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-38.png">38</a>]</span>
of a lovely maniac, ju&#383;t brought into
an adjoining chamber. She was &#383;inging
the pathetic ballad of old Rob &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
with the mo&#383;t heart-melting
falls and pau&#383;es. Jemima had half-opened
the door, when &#383;he di&#383;tingui&#383;hed
her voice, and Maria &#383;tood clo&#383;e to it,
&#383;carcely daring to re&#383;pire, le&#383;t a modulation
&#383;hould e&#383;cape her, &#383;o exqui&#383;itely
&#383;weet, &#383;o pa&#383;&#383;ionately wild. She
began with &#383;ympathy to pourtray to
her&#383;elf another victim, when the lovely
warbler flew, as it were, from the
&#383;pray, and a torrent of unconnected
exclamations and que&#383;tions bur&#383;t from
her, interrupted by fits of laughter, &#383;o
horrid, that Maria &#383;hut the door, and,
turning her eyes up to heaven, exclaimed&mdash;"Gracious
God!"</p>

<p>Several minutes elap&#383;ed before Maria
could enquire re&#383;pecting the ru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-39_S" id="Pg_1-39_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-39.png">39</a>]</span>mour
of the hou&#383;e (for this poor
wretch was obviou&#383;ly not confined
without a cau&#383;e); and then Jemima
could only tell her, that it was &#383;aid,
"&#383;he had been married, again&#383;t her
inclination, to a rich old man, extremely
jealous (no wonder, for &#383;he
was a charming creature); and that,
in con&#383;equence of his treatment, or
&#383;omething which hung on her mind,
&#383;he had, during her fir&#383;t lying-in, lo&#383;t
her &#383;en&#383;es."</p>

<p>What a &#383;ubject of meditation&mdash;even
to the very confines of madne&#383;s.</p>

<p>"Woman, fragile flower! why
were you &#383;uffered to adorn a world
expo&#383;ed to the inroad of &#383;uch &#383;tormy
elements?" thought Maria, while the
poor maniac's &#383;train was &#383;till breathing
on her ear, and &#383;inking into her very
&#383;oul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-40_S" id="Pg_1-40_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-40.png">40</a>]</span>
Towards the evening, Jemima brought
her Rou&#383;&#383;eau's <i>Helo&iuml;&#383;e</i>; and &#383;he &#383;at
reading with eyes and heart, till the
return of her guard to extingui&#383;h the
light. One in&#383;tance of her kindne&#383;s
was, the permitting Maria to have
one, till her own hour of retiring to
re&#383;t. She had read this work long
&#383;ince; but now it &#383;eemed to open a
new world to her&mdash;the only one worth
inhabiting. Sleep was not to be
wooed; yet, far from being fatigued
by the re&#383;tle&#383;s rotation of thought, &#383;he
ro&#383;e and opened her window, ju&#383;t as
the thin watery clouds of twilight
made the long &#383;ilent &#383;hadows vi&#383;ible.
The air &#383;wept acro&#383;s her face with a
voluptuous fre&#383;hne&#383;s that thrilled to
her heart, awakening indefinable emotions;
and the &#383;ound of a waving
branch, or the twittering of a &#383;tartled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-41_S" id="Pg_1-41_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-41.png">41</a>]</span>
bird, alone broke the &#383;tillne&#383;s of repo&#383;ing
nature. Ab&#383;orbed by the &#383;ublime
&#383;en&#383;ibility which renders the con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s
of exi&#383;tence felicity, Maria
was happy, till an autumnal &#383;cent,
wafted by the breeze of morn from
the fallen leaves of the adjacent wood,
made her recollect that the &#383;ea&#383;on had
changed &#383;ince her confinement; yet
life afforded no variety to &#383;olace an
afflicted heart. She returned di&#383;pirited
to her couch, and thought of her child
till the broad glare of day again invited
her to the window. She looked
not for the unknown, &#383;till how great
was her vexation at perceiving the
back of a man, certainly he, with his
two attendants, as he turned into a
&#383;ide-path which led to the hou&#383;e! A
confu&#383;ed recollection of having &#383;een
&#383;omebody who re&#383;embled him, imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-42_S" id="Pg_1-42_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-42.png">42</a>]</span>diately
occurred, to puzzle and torment
her with endle&#383;s conjectures. Five
minutes &#383;ooner, and &#383;he &#383;hould have
&#383;een his face, and been out of &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e&mdash;was
ever any thing &#383;o unlucky!
His &#383;teady, bold &#383;tep, and the whole
air of his per&#383;on, bur&#383;ting as it were
from a cloud, plea&#383;ed her, and gave
an outline to the imagination to &#383;ketch
the individual form &#383;he wi&#383;hed to recognize.</p>

<p>Feeling the di&#383;appointment more
&#383;everely than &#383;he was willing to believe,
&#383;he flew to Rou&#383;&#383;eau, as her
only refuge from the idea of him, who
might prove a friend, could &#383;he but
find a way to intere&#383;t him in her fate;
&#383;till the per&#383;onification of Saint Preux,
or of an ideal lover far &#383;uperior, was
after this imperfect model, of which
merely a glance had been caught,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-43_S" id="Pg_1-43_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-43.png">43</a>]</span>
even to the minuti&aelig; of the coat and
hat of the &#383;tranger. But if &#383;he lent
St. Preux, or the demi-god of her
fancy, his form, &#383;he richly repaid him
by the donation of all St. Preux's
&#383;entiments and feelings, culled to gratify
her own, to which he &#383;eemed to
have an undoubted right, when &#383;he
read on the margin of an impa&#383;&#383;ioned
letter, written in the well-known hand&mdash;"Rou&#383;&#383;eau
alone, the true Prometheus
of &#383;entiment, po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed the fire
of genius nece&#383;&#383;ary to pourtray the
pa&#383;&#383;ion, the truth of which goes &#383;o
directly to the heart."</p>

<p>Maria was again true to the hour, yet
had fini&#383;hed Rou&#383;&#383;eau, and begun to
tran&#383;cribe &#383;ome &#383;elected pa&#383;&#383;ages; unable
to quit either the author or the window,
before &#383;he had a glimp&#383;e of the
countenance &#383;he daily longed to &#383;ee;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-44_S" id="Pg_1-44_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-44.png">44</a>]</span>
and, when &#383;een, it conveyed no di&#383;tinct
idea to her mind where &#383;he had
&#383;een it before. He mu&#383;t have been a
tran&#383;ient acquaintance; but to di&#383;cover
an acquaintance was fortunate, could
&#383;he contrive to attract his attention,
and excite his &#383;ympathy.</p>

<p>Every glance afforded colouring for
the picture &#383;he was delineating on her
heart; and once, when the window
was half open, the &#383;ound of his voice
reached her. Conviction fla&#383;hed on
her; &#383;he had certainly, in a moment
of di&#383;tre&#383;s, heard the &#383;ame accents.
They were manly, and characteri&#383;tic
of a noble mind; nay, even &#383;weet&mdash;or
&#383;weet they &#383;eemed to her attentive
ear.</p>

<p>She &#383;tarted back, trembling, alarmed
at the emotion a &#383;trange coincidence
of circum&#383;tances in&#383;pired, and wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-45_S" id="Pg_1-45_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-45.png">45</a>]</span>ing
why &#383;he thought &#383;o much of a
&#383;tranger, obliged as &#383;he had been by
his timely interference; [for &#383;he recollected,
by degrees, all the circum&#383;tances
of their former meeting.] She
found however that &#383;he could think
of nothing el&#383;e; or, if &#383;he thought of
her daughter, it was to wi&#383;h that &#383;he
had a father whom her mother could
re&#383;pect and love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> peru&#383;ing the fir&#383;t parcel of

in one of them a few exclamations,
expre&#383;&#383;ive of compa&#383;&#383;ion and &#383;ympathy,
which &#383;he &#383;carcely remembered, till
turning over the leaves of one of the
volumes, lately brought to her, a &#383;lip
of paper dropped out, which Jemima
ha&#383;tily &#383;natched up.</p>

<p>"Let me &#383;ee it," demanded Maria

Jemima; and withdrew, with

<p>In a life of &#383;uch &#383;eclu&#383;ion, the pa&#383;&#383;ions

<p>By the mo&#383;t pre&#383;&#383;ing intreaties, Maria
prevailed on Jemima to permit her to
write a reply to this note. Another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-48_S" id="Pg_1-48_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-48.png">48</a>]</span>
and another &#383;ucceeded, in which explanations
were not allowed relative to
their pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation; but Maria, with
&#383;ufficient explicitne&#383;s, alluded to a former
obligation; and they in&#383;en&#383;ibly entered
on an interchange of &#383;entiments
on the mo&#383;t important &#383;ubjects. To
write the&#383;e letters was the bu&#383;ine&#383;s of
the day, and to receive them the moment
of &#383;un&#383;hine. By &#383;ome means,
Darnford having di&#383;covered Maria's
window, when &#383;he next appeared at
it, he made her, behind his keepers, a
profound bow of re&#383;pect and recognition.</p>

<p>Two or three weeks glided away in
this kind of intercour&#383;e, during which
period Jemima, to whom Maria had

her family, had evidently gained

de&#383;ire of plea&#383;ing her charge, though
&#383;he could not yet determine to liberate
her. Maria took advantage of this
favourable charge, without too minutely
enquiring into the cau&#383;e; and &#383;uch
was her eagerne&#383;s to hold human conver&#383;e,
and to &#383;ee her former protector,
&#383;till a &#383;tranger to her, that &#383;he ince&#383;&#383;antly
reque&#383;ted her guard to gratify her more
than curio&#383;ity.</p>

<p>Writing to Darnford, &#383;he was led
from the &#383;ad objects before her, and
frequently rendered in&#383;en&#383;ible to the
horrid noi&#383;es around her, which previou&#383;ly
had continually employed her
feveri&#383;h fancy. Thinking it &#383;elfi&#383;h to
dwell on her own &#383;ufferings, when in
the mid&#383;t of wretches, who had not
only lo&#383;t all that endears life, but their
very &#383;elves, her imagination was oc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-50_S" id="Pg_1-50_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-50.png">50</a>]</span>cupied
with melancholy earne&#383;tne&#383;s to
trace the mazes of mi&#383;ery, through
which &#383;o many wretches mu&#383;t have
pa&#383;&#383;ed to this gloomy receptacle of di&#383;jointed
&#383;ouls, to the grand &#383;ource of
human corruption. Often at midnight
was &#383;he waked by the di&#383;mal &#383;hrieks of
demoniac rage, or of excruciating de&#383;pair,
uttered in &#383;uch wild tones of inde&#383;cribable
angui&#383;h as proved the total
ab&#383;ence of rea&#383;on, and rou&#383;ed phantoms
of horror in her mind, far more
terrific than all that dreaming &#383;uper&#383;tition
ever drew. Be&#383;ides, there was
frequently &#383;omething &#383;o inconceivably
picture&#383;que in the varying ge&#383;tures of
unre&#383;trained pa&#383;&#383;ion, &#383;o irre&#383;i&#383;tibly comic
in their &#383;allies, or &#383;o heart-piercingly
pathetic in the little airs they would
&#383;ing, frequently bur&#383;ting out after an
awful &#383;ilence, as to fa&#383;cinate the at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-51_S" id="Pg_1-51_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-51.png">51</a>]</span>tention,
and amu&#383;e the fancy, while
torturing the &#383;oul. It was the uproar
of the pa&#383;&#383;ions which &#383;he was compelled
to ob&#383;erve; and to mark the
lucid beam of rea&#383;on, like a light
trembling in a &#383;ocket, or like the
fla&#383;h which divides the threatening
clouds of angry heaven only to di&#383;play
the horrors which darkne&#383;s &#383;hrouded.</p>

<p>Jemima would labour to beguile the
tedious evenings, by de&#383;cribing the
per&#383;ons and manners of the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unfortutunate'">unfortunate</ins>
beings, who&#383;e figures or voices
awoke &#383;ympathetic &#383;orrow in Maria's
bo&#383;om; and the &#383;tories &#383;he told were
the more intere&#383;ting, for perpetually
leaving room to conjecture &#383;omething
extraordinary. Still Maria, accu&#383;tomed
to generalize her ob&#383;ervations, was
led to conclude from all &#383;he heard,
that it was a vulgar error to &#383;uppo&#383;e<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-52_S" id="Pg_1-52_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-52.png">52</a>]</span>
that people of abilities were the mo&#383;t
apt to lo&#383;e the command of rea&#383;on.
On the contrary, from mo&#383;t of the in&#383;tances
&#383;he could inve&#383;tigate, &#383;he thought
it re&#383;ulted, that the pa&#383;&#383;ions only appeared
&#383;trong and di&#383;proportioned, becau&#383;e
the judgment was weak and unexerci&#383;ed;
and that they gained &#383;trength
by the decay of rea&#383;on, as the &#383;hadows
lengthen during the &#383;un's decline.</p>

<p>Maria impatiently wi&#383;hed to &#383;ee her
fellow-&#383;ufferer; but Darnford was &#383;till
more earne&#383;t to obtain an interview.
Accu&#383;tomed to &#383;ubmit to every impul&#383;e
of pa&#383;&#383;ion, and never taught, like
women, to re&#383;train the mo&#383;t natural,
and acquire, in&#383;tead of the bewitching
frankne&#383;s of nature, a factitious propriety
of behaviour, every de&#383;ire became
a torrent that bore down all oppo&#383;ition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-53_S" id="Pg_1-53_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-53.png">53</a>]</span>
His travelling trunk, which contained
the books lent to Maria, had
been &#383;ent to him, and with a part of
its contents he bribed his principal
keeper; who, after receiving the mo&#383;t
&#383;olemn promi&#383;e that he would return
to his apartment without attempting
to explore any part of the hou&#383;e, conducted
him, in the du&#383;k of the evening,
to Maria's room.</p>

<p>Jemima had apprized her charge of
the vi&#383;it, and &#383;he expected with trembling
impatience, in&#383;pired by a vague
hope that he might again prove her
deliverer, to &#383;ee a man who had before
re&#383;cued her from oppre&#383;&#383;ion. He entered
with an animation of countenance,
formed to captivate an enthu&#383;ia&#383;t;
and, ha&#383;tily turned his eyes from
her to the apartment, which he &#383;urveyed
with apparent emotions of com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-54_S" id="Pg_1-54_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-54.png">54</a>]</span>pa&#383;&#383;ionate
indignation. Sympathy illuminated
his eye, and, taking her hand,
he re&#383;pectfully bowed on it, exclaiming&mdash;"This
is extraordinary!&mdash;again
to meet you, and in &#383;uch circum&#383;tances!"
Still, impre&#383;&#383;ive as was the
coincidence of events which brought
them once more together, their full
hearts did not overflow.&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_54-A_3_S" id="FNanchor_54-A_3_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_54-A_3_S" class="fnanchor">[54-A]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>[And though, after this fir&#383;t vi&#383;it,
they were permitted frequently to repeat
their interviews, they were for
&#383;ome time employed in] a re&#383;erved
conver&#383;ation, to which all the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-55_S" id="Pg_1-55_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-55.png">55</a>]</span>
might have li&#383;tened; excepting, when
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing &#383;ome literary &#383;ubject, fla&#383;hes
of &#383;entiment, inforced by each relaxing
feature, &#383;eemed to remind them
that their minds were already acquainted.</p>

<p>[By degrees, Darnford entered into
the particulars of his &#383;tory.] In a few
words, he informed her that he had been
a thoughtle&#383;s, extravagant young man;
yet, as he de&#383;cribed his faults, they appeared
to be the generous luxuriancy of
a noble mind. Nothing like meanne&#383;s
tarni&#383;hed the lu&#383;tre of his youth, nor had
the worm of &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s lurked in the unfolding
bud, even while he had been the
dupe of others. Yet he tardily acquired
the experience nece&#383;&#383;ary to guard
him again&#383;t future impo&#383;ition.</p>

<p>"I &#383;hall weary you," continued he,
"by my egoti&#383;m; and did not power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-56_S" id="Pg_1-56_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-56.png">56</a>]</span>ful
emotions draw me to you,"&mdash;his
eyes gli&#383;tened as he &#383;poke, and a trembling
&#383;eemed to run through his manly
frame,&mdash;"I would not wa&#383;te the&#383;e precious
moments in talking of my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>"My father and mother were people
of fa&#383;hion; married by their parents. He
was fond of the turf, &#383;he of the card-table.
I, and two or three other children
&#383;ince dead, were kept at home
till we became intolerable. My father
and mother had a vi&#383;ible di&#383;like
to each other, continually di&#383;played;
the &#383;ervants were of the depraved kind
u&#383;ually found in the hou&#383;es of people
of fortune. My brothers and parents
all dying, I was left to the care of
guardians, and &#383;ent to Eton. I never
knew the &#383;weets of dome&#383;tic affection,
but I felt the want of indulgence and
frivolous re&#383;pect at &#383;chool. I will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-57_S" id="Pg_1-57_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-57.png">57</a>]</span>
di&#383;gu&#383;t you with a recital of the vices
of my youth, which can &#383;carcely be comprehended
by female delicacy. I was
taught to love by a creature I am
a&#383;hamed to mention; and the other
women with whom I afterwards became
intimate, were of a cla&#383;s of which
you can have no knowledge. I formed
my acquaintance with them at the
theatres; and, when vivacity danced
in their eyes, I was not ea&#383;ily di&#383;gu&#383;ted
by the vulgarity which flowed from
their lips. Having &#383;pent, a few years
after I was of age, [the whole of] a
con&#383;iderable patrimony, excepting a
few hundreds, I had no <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 're&#383;ource'">recour&#383;e</ins> but
to purcha&#383;e a commi&#383;&#383;ion in a new-rai&#383;ed
regiment, de&#383;tined to &#383;ubjugate
America. The regret I felt to renounce
a life of plea&#383;ure, was counter-balanced
by the curio&#383;ity I had to &#383;ee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-58_S" id="Pg_1-58_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-58.png">58</a>]</span>
America, or rather to travel; [nor
had any of tho&#383;e circum&#383;tances occurred
to my youth, which might have
been calculated] to bind my country
to my heart. I &#383;hall not trouble you
with the details of a military life. My
blood was &#383;till kept in motion; till,
towards the clo&#383;e of the conte&#383;t, I was
wounded and taken pri&#383;oner.</p>

<p>"Confined to my bed, or chair, by a
lingering cure, my only refuge from
the preying activity of my mind, was
books, which I read with great avidity,
profiting by the conver&#383;ation of my
ho&#383;t, a man of &#383;ound under&#383;tanding.
My political &#383;entiments now underwent
a total change; and, dazzled by
the ho&#383;pitality of the Americans, I
determined to take up my abode with
freedom. I, therefore, with my u&#383;ual
impetuo&#383;ity, &#383;old my commi&#383;&#383;ion, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-59_S" id="Pg_1-59_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-59.png">59</a>]</span>
travelled into the interior parts of the
country, to lay out my money to advantage.
Added to this, I did not
much like the puritanical manners of
the large towns. Inequality of condition
was there mo&#383;t di&#383;gu&#383;tingly galling.
The only plea&#383;ure wealth afforded,
was to make an o&#383;tentatious
di&#383;play of it; for the cultivation of
the fine arts, or literature, had not introduced
into the fir&#383;t circles that poli&#383;h
of manners which renders the rich &#383;o e&#383;&#383;entially
&#383;uperior to the poor in Europe.
Added to this, an influx of vices had
been let in by the Revolution, and the
mo&#383;t rigid principles of religion &#383;haken
to the centre, before the under&#383;tanding
could be gradually emancipated from
the prejudices which led their ance&#383;tors
undauntedly to &#383;eek an inho&#383;pitable
clime and unbroken &#383;oil. The re&#383;olu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-60_S" id="Pg_1-60_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-60.png">60</a>]</span>tion,
that led them, in pur&#383;uit of independence,
to embark on rivers like
&#383;eas, to &#383;earch for unknown &#383;hores,
and to &#383;leep under the hovering mi&#383;ts
of endle&#383;s fore&#383;ts, who&#383;e baleful damps
agued their limbs, was now turned into
commercial &#383;peculations, till the national
character exhibited a phenomenon
in the hi&#383;tory of the human mind&mdash;a
head enthu&#383;ia&#383;tically enterpri&#383;ing, with
cold &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s of heart. And woman,
lovely woman!&mdash;they charm every
where&mdash;&#383;till there is a degree of prudery,
and a want of ta&#383;te and ea&#383;e in
the manners of the American women,
that renders them, in &#383;pite of their ro&#383;es
and lilies, far inferior to our European
charmers. In the country, they have
often a bewitching &#383;implicity of character;
but, in the cities, they have all
the airs and ignorance of the ladies who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-61_S" id="Pg_1-61_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-61.png">61</a>]</span>
give the tone to the circles of the large
trading towns in England. They are
fond of their ornaments, merely becau&#383;e
they are good, and not becau&#383;e
they embelli&#383;h their per&#383;ons; and are
more gratified to in&#383;pire the women
with jealou&#383;y of the&#383;e exterior advantages,
than the men with love. All
the frivolity which often (excu&#383;e me,
Madam) renders the &#383;ociety of mode&#383;t
women &#383;o &#383;tupid in England, here
&#383;eemed to throw &#383;till more leaden fetters
on their charms. Not being an
adept in gallantry, I found that I could
only keep my&#383;elf awake in their company
by making downright love to
them.</p>

<p>"But, not to intrude on your patience,
I retired to the track of land
which I had purcha&#383;ed in the country,
and my time pa&#383;&#383;ed plea&#383;antly enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-62_S" id="Pg_1-62_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-62.png">62</a>]</span>
while I cut down the trees, built my
hou&#383;e, and planted my different crops.
But winter and idlene&#383;s came, and I
longed for more elegant &#383;ociety, to hear
what was pa&#383;&#383;ing in the world, and to
do &#383;omething better than vegetate with
the animals that made a very con&#383;iderable
part of my hou&#383;ehold. Con&#383;equently,
I determined to travel. Motion was
a &#383;ub&#383;titute for variety of objects; and,
pa&#383;&#383;ing over immen&#383;e tracks of country,
I exhau&#383;ted my exuberant &#383;pirits, without
obtaining much experience. I every
where &#383;aw indu&#383;try the fore-runner
and not the con&#383;equence, of luxury;
but this country, every thing being on
an ample &#383;cale, did not afford tho&#383;e
picture&#383;que views, which a certain degree
of cultivation is nece&#383;&#383;ary gradually
to produce. The eye wandered
without an object to fix upon over im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-63_S" id="Pg_1-63_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-63.png">63</a>]</span>mea&#383;ureable
plains, and lakes that &#383;eemed
repleni&#383;hed by the ocean, whil&#383;t eternal
fore&#383;ts of &#383;mall clu&#383;tering trees, ob&#383;tructed
the circulation of air, and embarra&#383;&#383;ed
the path, without gratifying
the eye of ta&#383;te. No cottage &#383;miling in
the wa&#383;te, no travellers hailed us, to give
life to &#383;ilent nature; or, if perchance
we &#383;aw the print of a foot&#383;tep in our
path, it was a dreadful warning to turn
a&#383;ide; and the head ached as if a&#383;&#383;ailed
by the &#383;calping knife. The Indians
who hovered on the &#383;kirts of the European
&#383;ettlements had only learned of
their neighbours to plunder, and they
&#383;tole their guns from them to do it with
more &#383;afety.</p>

<p>"From the woods and back &#383;ettlements,
I returned to the towns, and
learned to eat and drink mo&#383;t valiantly;
but without entering into commerce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-64_S" id="Pg_1-64_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-64.png">64</a>]</span>
(and I dete&#383;ted commerce) I found I
could not live there; and, growing heartily
weary of the land of liberty and
vulgar ari&#383;tocracy, &#383;eated on her bags
of dollars, I re&#383;olved once more to vi&#383;it
Europe. I wrote to a di&#383;tant relation
in England, with whom I had been
educated, mentioning the ve&#383;&#383;el in
which I intended to &#383;ail. Arriving in
London, my &#383;en&#383;es were intoxicated. I
ran from &#383;treet to &#383;treet, from theatre
to theatre, and the women of the town
(again I mu&#383;t beg pardon for my habitual
frankne&#383;s) appeared to me like
angels.</p>

<p>"A week was &#383;pent in this thoughtle&#383;s
manner, when, returning very late
to the hotel in which I had lodged ever
&#383;ince my arrival, I was knocked down
in a private &#383;treet, and hurried, in a &#383;tate
of in&#383;en&#383;ibility, into a coach, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-65_S" id="Pg_1-65_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-65.png">65</a>]</span>
brought me hither, and I only recovered
my &#383;en&#383;es to be treated like one
who had lo&#383;t them. My keepers are
deaf to my remon&#383;trances and enquiries,
yet a&#383;&#383;ure me that my confinement
&#383;hall not la&#383;t long. Still I cannot gue&#383;s,
though I weary my&#383;elf with conjectures,
why I am confined, or in what
part of England this hou&#383;e is &#383;ituated.
I imagine &#383;ometimes that I hear the
&#383;ea roar, and wi&#383;hed my&#383;elf again on
the Atlantic, till I had a glimp&#383;e of
you<a name="FNanchor_65-A_4_S" id="FNanchor_65-A_4_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_65-A_4_S" class="fnanchor">[65-A]</a>."</p>

<p>Maria was &#383;ix-and-twenty. But,
&#383;uch was the native &#383;oundne&#383;s of her
con&#383;titution, that time had only given
to her countenance the character of her

the playful graces of innocence, producing
in&#383;en&#383;ibly that irregularity of
features which the &#383;truggles of the under&#383;tanding
to trace or govern the
&#383;trong emotions of the heart, are wont
to imprint on the yielding ma&#383;s. Grief
and care had mellowed, without ob&#383;curing,
the bright tints of youth, and
the thoughtfulne&#383;s which re&#383;ided on her
brow did not take from the feminine
&#383;oftne&#383;s of her features; nay, &#383;uch was
the &#383;en&#383;ibility which often mantled over
it, that &#383;he frequently appeared, like a
large proportion of her &#383;ex, only born
to feel; and the activity of her well-proportioned,
and even almo&#383;t voluptuous
figure, in&#383;pired the idea of
&#383;trength of mind, rather than of body.
There was a &#383;implicity &#383;ometimes indeed
in her manner, which bordered
on infantine ingenuou&#383;ne&#383;s, that led peo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-69_S" id="Pg_1-69_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-69.png">69</a>]</span>ple
of common di&#383;cernment to underrate
her talents, and &#383;mile at the flights
of her imagination. But tho&#383;e who
could not comprehend the delicacy of
her &#383;entiments, were attached by her
unfailing &#383;ympathy, &#383;o that &#383;he was very
generally beloved by characters of very
different de&#383;criptions; &#383;till, &#383;he was too
much under the influence of an ardent
imagination to adhere to common rules.</p>

<p>There are mi&#383;takes of conduct which
at five-and-twenty prove the &#383;trength of
the mind, that, ten or fifteen years after,
would demon&#383;trate its weakne&#383;s, its incapacity
to acquire a &#383;ane judgment.
The youths who are &#383;ati&#383;fied with the
ordinary plea&#383;ures of life, and do not
&#383;igh after ideal phantoms of love and
friend&#383;hip, will never arrive at great maturity
of under&#383;tanding; but if the&#383;e reveries
are cheri&#383;hed, as is too frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-70_S" id="Pg_1-70_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-70.png">70</a>]</span>
the ca&#383;e with women, when experience
ought to have taught them in what human
happine&#383;s con&#383;i&#383;ts, they become as
u&#383;ele&#383;s as they are wretched. Be&#383;ides,
their pains and plea&#383;ures are &#383;o dependent
on outward circum&#383;tances, on the
objects of their affections, that they
&#383;eldom act from the impul&#383;e of a nerved
mind, able to choo&#383;e its own pur&#383;uit.</p>

<p>Having had to &#383;truggle ince&#383;&#383;antly
with the vices of mankind, Maria's
imagination found repo&#383;e in pourtraying
the po&#383;&#383;ible virtues the world might
contain. Pygmalion formed an ivory
maid, and longed for an informing &#383;oul.
She, on the contrary, combined all the
qualities of a hero's mind, and fate
pre&#383;ented a &#383;tatue in which &#383;he might
en&#383;hrine them.</p>

<p>We mean not to trace the progre&#383;s
of this pa&#383;&#383;ion, or recount how often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-71_S" id="Pg_1-71_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-71.png">71</a>]</span>
Darnford and Maria were obliged to
part in the mid&#383;t of an intere&#383;ting conver&#383;ation.
Jemima ever watched on
the tip-toe of fear, and frequently &#383;eparated
them on a fal&#383;e alarm, when
they would have given worlds to remain
a little longer together.</p>

<p>A magic lamp now &#383;eemed to be &#383;u&#383;pended
in Maria's pri&#383;on, and fairy
land&#383;capes flitted round the gloomy
walls, late &#383;o blank. Ru&#383;hing from the
depth of de&#383;pair, on the &#383;eraph wing of
hope, &#383;he found her&#383;elf happy.&mdash;She was
beloved, and every emotion was rapturous.</p>

<p>To Darnford &#383;he had not &#383;hown a decided
affection; the fear of outrunning
his, a &#383;ure proof of love, made her often
a&#383;&#383;ume a coldne&#383;s and indifference foreign
from her character; and, even when
giving way to the playful emotions of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-72_S" id="Pg_1-72_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-72.png">72</a>]</span>
heart ju&#383;t loo&#383;ened from the frozen
bond of grief, there was a delicacy in
her manner of expre&#383;&#383;ing her &#383;en&#383;ibility,
which made him doubt whether it
was the effect of love.</p>

<p>One evening, when Jemima left them,
to li&#383;ten to the &#383;ound of a di&#383;tant foot&#383;tep,
which &#383;eemed cautiou&#383;ly to approach,
he &#383;eized Maria's hand&mdash;it was
not withdrawn. They conver&#383;ed with
earne&#383;tne&#383;s of their &#383;ituation; and, during
the conver&#383;ation, he once or twice
gently drew her towards him. He felt
the fragrance of her breath, and longed,
yet feared, to touch the lips from
which it i&#383;&#383;ued; &#383;pirits of purity &#383;eemed
to guard them, while all the enchanting
graces of love &#383;ported on her cheeks,
and langui&#383;hed in her eyes.</p>

<p>Jemima entering, he reflected on his
diffidence with poignant regret, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-73_S" id="Pg_1-73_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-73.png">73</a>]</span>
&#383;he once more taking alarm, he ventured,
as Maria &#383;tood near his chair, to
approach her lips with a declaration of
love. She drew back with &#383;olemnity,
he hung down his head aba&#383;hed; but
lifting his eyes timidly, they met her's;
&#383;he had determined, during that in&#383;tant,
and &#383;uffered their rays to mingle. He
took, with more ardour, rea&#383;&#383;ured, a
half-con&#383;enting, half-reluctant ki&#383;s, reluctant
only from mode&#383;ty; and there
was a &#383;acredne&#383;s in her dignified manner
of reclining her glowing face on
his &#383;houlder, that powerfully impre&#383;&#383;ed
him. De&#383;ire was lo&#383;t in more ineffable
emotions, and to protect her from in&#383;ult
and &#383;orrow&mdash;to make her happy,
&#383;eemed not only the fir&#383;t wi&#383;h of his heart,
but the mo&#383;t noble duty of his life.
Such angelic confidence demanded the
fidelity of honour; but could he, feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-74_S" id="Pg_1-74_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-74.png">74</a>]</span>ing
her in every pul&#383;ation, could he
ever change, could he be a villain? The
emotion with which &#383;he, for a moment,
allowed her&#383;elf to be pre&#383;&#383;ed to his bo&#383;om,
the tear of rapturous &#383;ympathy,
mingled with a &#383;oft melancholy &#383;entiment
of recollected di&#383;appointment,
&#383;aid&mdash;more of truth and faithfulne&#383;s,
than the tongue could have given utterance
to in hours! They were &#383;ilent&mdash;yet
di&#383;cour&#383;ed, how eloquently? till,
after a moment's reflection, Maria drew
her chair by the &#383;ide of his, and, with
a compo&#383;ed &#383;weetne&#383;s of voice, and
&#383;upernatural benignity of countenance,
&#383;aid, "I mu&#383;t open my whole heart
to you; you mu&#383;t be told who I am,
why I am here, and why, telling you
I am a wife, I blu&#383;h not to"&mdash;the blu&#383;h
&#383;poke the re&#383;t.</p>

<p>Jemima was again at her elbow, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-75_S" id="Pg_1-75_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-75.png">75</a>]</span>
the re&#383;traint of her pre&#383;ence did not
prevent an animated conver&#383;ation, in
which love, &#383;ly urchin, was ever at bo-peep.</p>

<p>So much of heaven did they enjoy,
that paradi&#383;e bloomed around them; or
they, by a powerful &#383;pell, had been
tran&#383;ported into Armida's garden. Love,
the grand enchanter, "lapt them in Ely&#383;ium,"
and every &#383;en&#383;e was harmonized
to joy and &#383;ocial extacy. So animated,
indeed, were their accents of tenderne&#383;s,
in di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing what, in other circum&#383;tances,
would have been common-place
&#383;ubjects, that Jemima felt, with
&#383;urpri&#383;e, a tear of plea&#383;ure trickling
down her rugged cheeks. She wiped
it away, half a&#383;hamed; and when Maria
kindly enquired the cau&#383;e, with all
the eager &#383;olicitude of a happy being
wi&#383;hing to impart to all nature its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-76_S" id="Pg_1-76_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-76.png">76</a>]</span>
overflowing felicity, Jemima owned
that it was the fir&#383;t tear that &#383;ocial enjoyment
had ever drawn from her. She
&#383;eemed indeed to breathe more freely;
the cloud of &#383;u&#383;picion cleared away
from her brow; &#383;he felt her&#383;elf, for
once in her life, treated like a fellow-creature.</p>

<p>Imagination! who can paint thy
power; or reflect the evane&#383;cent tints
of hope fo&#383;tered by thee? A de&#383;pondent
gloom had long ob&#383;cured Maria's horizon&mdash;now
the &#383;un broke forth, the
rainbow appeared, and every pro&#383;pect
was fair. Horror &#383;till reigned in the
darkened cells, &#383;u&#383;picion lurked in the
pa&#383;&#383;ages, and whi&#383;pered along the
walls. The yells of men po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed,
&#383;ometimes made them pau&#383;e, and wonder
that they felt &#383;o happy, in a tomb
of living death. They even chid them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-77_S" id="Pg_1-77_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-77.png">77</a>]</span>&#383;elves
for &#383;uch apparent in&#383;en&#383;ibility;
&#383;till the world contained not three happier
beings. And Jemima, after again
patrolling the pa&#383;&#383;age, was &#383;o &#383;oftened
by the air of confidence which breathed
around her, that &#383;he voluntarily began
an account of her&#383;elf.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_V_S" id="CHAP_V_S"></a>CHAP. V.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> father," &#383;aid Jemima, "&#383;educed
my mother, a pretty girl, with whom
he lived fellow-&#383;ervant; and &#383;he no
&#383;ooner perceived the natural, the dreaded
con&#383;equence, than the terrible conviction
fla&#383;hed on her&mdash;that &#383;he was
ruined. Hone&#383;ty, and a regard for her
reputation, had been the only principles
inculcated by her mother; and
they had been &#383;o forcibly impre&#383;&#383;ed, that
&#383;he feared &#383;hame, more than the poverty
to which it would lead. Her ince&#383;&#383;ant
importunities to prevail upon my father
to &#383;creen her from reproach by marrying
her, as he had promi&#383;ed in the
fervour of &#383;eduction, e&#383;tranged him from
her &#383;o completely, that her very per&#383;on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-79_S" id="Pg_1-79_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-79.png">79</a>]</span>
became di&#383;ta&#383;teful to him; and he began
to hate, as well as de&#383;pi&#383;e me, before
I was born.</p>

<p>"My mother, grieved to the &#383;oul by
his neglect, and unkind treatment, actually
re&#383;olved to fami&#383;h her&#383;elf; and
injured her health by the attempt;
though &#383;he had not &#383;ufficient re&#383;olution
to adhere to her project, or renounce it
entirely. Death came not at her call;
yet &#383;orrow, and the methods &#383;he adopted
to conceal her condition, &#383;till doing the
work of a hou&#383;e-maid, had &#383;uch an
effect on her con&#383;titution, that &#383;he died
in the wretched garret, where her virtuous
mi&#383;tre&#383;s had forced her to take
refuge in the very pangs of labour,
though my father, after a &#383;light reproof,
was allowed to remain in his place&mdash;allowed
by the mother of &#383;ix children,
who, &#383;carcely permitting a foot&#383;tep to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-80_S" id="Pg_1-80_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-80.png">80</a>]</span>
be heard, during her month's indulgence,
felt no &#383;ympathy for the poor
wretch, denied every comfort required
by her &#383;ituation.</p>

<p>"The day my mother died, the
ninth after my birth, I was con&#383;igned
to the care of the cheape&#383;t nur&#383;e my
father could find; who &#383;uckled her own
child at the &#383;ame time, and lodged as
many more as &#383;he could get, in two
cellar-like apartments.</p>

<p>"Poverty, and the habit of &#383;eeing
children die off her hands, had &#383;o
hardened her heart, that the office of a
mother did not awaken the tenderne&#383;s
of a woman; nor were the feminine
care&#383;&#383;es which &#383;eem a part of the rearing
of a child, ever be&#383;towed on me.
The chicken has a wing to &#383;helter under;
but I had no bo&#383;om to ne&#383;tle in,
no kindred warmth to fo&#383;ter me. Left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-81_S" id="Pg_1-81_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-81.png">81</a>]</span>
in dirt, to cry with cold and hunger
till I was weary, and &#383;leep without ever
being prepared by exerci&#383;e, or lulled
by kindne&#383;s to re&#383;t; could I be expected
to become any thing but a weak and
rickety babe? Still, in &#383;pite of neglect,
I continued to exi&#383;t, to learn to
cur&#383;e exi&#383;tence,<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads '['">"</ins> her countenance grew
ferocious as &#383;he &#383;poke, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads ']'">"</ins>and the treatment
that rendered me mi&#383;erable, &#383;eemed
to &#383;harpen my wits. Confined then
in a damp hovel, to rock the cradle of
the &#383;ucceeding tribe, I looked like a
little old woman, or a hag &#383;hrivelling into
nothing. The furrows of reflection and
care contracted the youthful cheek,
and gave a &#383;ort of &#383;upernatural wildne&#383;s
to the ever watchful eye. During
this period, my father had married another
fellow-&#383;ervant, who loved him
le&#383;s, and knew better how to manage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-82_S" id="Pg_1-82_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-82.png">82</a>]</span>
his pa&#383;&#383;ion, than my mother. She likewi&#383;e
proving with child, they agreed
to keep a &#383;hop: my &#383;tep-mother, if, being
an illegitimate off&#383;pring, I may
venture thus to characterize her, having
obtained a &#383;um of a rich relation,
for that purpo&#383;e.</p>

<p>"Soon after her lying-in, &#383;he prevailed
on my father to take me home, to &#383;ave
the expence of maintaining me, and
of hiring a girl to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t her in the care
of the child. I was young, it was true,
but appeared a knowing little thing,
and might be made handy. Accordingly
I was brought to her hou&#383;e; but
not to a home&mdash;for a home I never
knew. Of this child, a daughter, &#383;he
was extravagantly fond; and it was a
part of my employment, to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t to &#383;poil
her, by humouring all her whims, and
bearing all her caprices. Feeling her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-83_S" id="Pg_1-83_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-83.png">83</a>]</span>
own con&#383;equence, before &#383;he could
&#383;peak, &#383;he had learned the art of tormenting
me, and if I ever dared to re&#383;i&#383;t,
I received blows, laid on with no
compunctious hand, or was &#383;ent to bed
dinnerle&#383;s, as well as &#383;upperle&#383;s. I &#383;aid
that it was a part of my daily labour to
attend this child, with the &#383;ervility of a
&#383;lave; &#383;till it was but a part. I was
&#383;ent out in all &#383;ea&#383;ons, and from place
to place, to carry burdens far above
my &#383;trength, without being allowed to
draw near the fire, or ever being
cheered by encouragement or kindne&#383;s.
No wonder then, treated like a
creature of another &#383;pecies, that I began
to envy, and at length to hate,
the darling of the hou&#383;e. Yet, I perfectly
remember, that it was the care&#383;&#383;es,
and kind expre&#383;&#383;ions of my &#383;tep-mother,
which fir&#383;t excited my jealous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-84_S" id="Pg_1-84_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-84.png">84</a>]</span>
di&#383;content. Once, I cannot forget it,
when &#383;he was calling in vain her wayward
child to ki&#383;s her, I ran to her,
&#383;aying, 'I will ki&#383;s you, ma'am!' and
how did my heart, which was in my
mouth, &#383;ink, what was my deba&#383;ement
of &#383;oul, when pu&#383;hed away with&mdash;'I
do not want you, pert thing!'
Another day, when a new gown had
excited the highe&#383;t good humour, and
&#383;he uttered the appropriate <i>dear</i>, addre&#383;&#383;ed
unexpectedly to me, I thought
I could never do enough to plea&#383;e her;
I was all alacrity, and ro&#383;e proportionably
in my own e&#383;timation.</p>

<p>"As her daughter grew up, &#383;he was
pampered with cakes and fruit, while
I was, literally &#383;peaking, fed with the
refu&#383;e of the table, with her leavings.
A liquori&#383;h tooth is, I believe, common
to children, and I u&#383;ed to &#383;teal any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-85_S" id="Pg_1-85_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-85.png">85</a>]</span>
thing &#383;weet, that I could catch up with
a chance of concealment. When detected,
&#383;he was not content to cha&#383;tize
me her&#383;elf at the moment, but, on my
father's return in the evening (he was
a &#383;hopman), the principal di&#383;cour&#383;e was
to recount my faults, and attribute
them to the wicked di&#383;po&#383;ition which I
had brought into the world with me,
inherited from my mother. He did not
fail to leave the marks of his re&#383;entment
on my body, and then &#383;olaced
him&#383;elf by playing with my &#383;i&#383;ter.&mdash;I
could have murdered her at tho&#383;e moments.
To &#383;ave my&#383;elf from the&#383;e unmerciful
corrections, I re&#383;orted to fal&#383;hood,
and the untruths which I &#383;turdily
maintained, were brought in judgment
again&#383;t me, to &#383;upport my tyrant's
inhuman charge of my natural propen&#383;ity
to vice. Seeing me treated with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-86_S" id="Pg_1-86_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-86.png">86</a>]</span>
contempt, and always being fed and
dre&#383;&#383;ed better, my &#383;i&#383;ter conceived a
contemptuous opinion of me, that
proved an ob&#383;tacle to all affection; and
my father, hearing continually of my
faults, began to con&#383;ider me as a cur&#383;e
entailed on him for his &#383;ins: he was
therefore ea&#383;ily prevailed on to bind
me apprentice to one of my &#383;tep-mother's
friends, who kept a &#383;lop-&#383;hop in
Wapping. I was repre&#383;ented (as it
was &#383;aid) in my true colours; but &#383;he,
'warranted,' &#383;napping her fingers,
'that &#383;he &#383;hould break my &#383;pirit or
heart.'</p>

<p>"My mother replied, with a whine,
'that if any body could make me better,
it was &#383;uch a clever woman as her&#383;elf;
though, for her own part, &#383;he had
tried in vain; but good-nature was her
fault.'</p>

"I &#383;hudder with horror, when I recollect
the treatment I had now to endure.
Not only under the la&#383;h of my ta&#383;k-mi&#383;tre&#383;s,
but the drudge of the maid,
apprentices and children, I never had
a ta&#383;te of human kindne&#383;s to &#383;often the
rigour of perpetual labour. I had been
introduced as an object of abhorrence
into the family; as a creature of whom
my &#383;tep-mother, though &#383;he had been
kind enough to let me live in the hou&#383;e
with her own child, could make nothing.
I was de&#383;cribed as a wretch,
who&#383;e no&#383;e mu&#383;t be kept to the grinding
&#383;tone&mdash;and it was held there with
an iron gra&#383;p. It &#383;eemed indeed the
privilege of their &#383;uperior nature to kick
me about, like the dog or cat. If I
were attentive, I was called fawning,
if refractory, an ob&#383;tinate mule, and
like a mule I received their cen&#383;ure on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-88_S" id="Pg_1-88_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-88.png">88</a>]</span>
my loaded back. Often has my mi&#383;tre&#383;s,
for &#383;ome in&#383;tance of forgetfulne&#383;s, thrown
me from one &#383;ide of the kitchen to the
other, knocked my head again&#383;t the
wall, &#383;pit in my face, with various refinements
on barbarity that I forbear to
enumerate, though they were all acted
over again by the &#383;ervant, with additional
in&#383;ults, to which the appellation
of <i>ba&#383;tard</i>, was commonly added, with
taunts or &#383;neers. But I will not attempt
to give you an adequate idea of
my &#383;ituation, le&#383;t you, who probably
have never been drenched with the
dregs of human mi&#383;ery, &#383;hould think I
exaggerate.</p>

<p>"I &#383;tole now, from ab&#383;olute nece&#383;&#383;ity,&mdash;bread;
yet whatever el&#383;e was
taken, which I had it not in my power
to take, was a&#383;cribed to me. I was
the filching cat, the ravenous dog, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-89_S" id="Pg_1-89_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-89.png">89</a>]</span>
dumb brute, who mu&#383;t bear all; for if
I endeavoured to exculpate my&#383;elf, I
was &#383;ilenced, without any enquiries
being made, with 'Hold your tongue,
you never tell truth.' Even the very
air I breathed was tainted with &#383;corn;
for I was &#383;ent to the neighbouring &#383;hops
with Glutton, Liar, or Thief, written on
my forehead. This was, at fir&#383;t, the
mo&#383;t bitter puni&#383;hment; but &#383;ullen
pride, or a kind of &#383;tupid de&#383;peration,
made me, at length, almo&#383;t regardle&#383;s
of the contempt, which had wrung
from me &#383;o many &#383;olitary tears at the
only moments when I was allowed to
re&#383;t.</p>

<p>"Thus was I the mark of cruelty till
my &#383;ixteenth year; and then I have
only to point out a change of mi&#383;ery;
for a period I never knew. Allow me
fir&#383;t to make one ob&#383;ervation. Now I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-90_S" id="Pg_1-90_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-90.png">90</a>]</span>
look back, I cannot help attributing the
greater part of my mi&#383;ery, to the mi&#383;fortune
of having been thrown into the
world without the grand &#383;upport of life&mdash;a
mother's affection. I had no one to
love me; or to make me re&#383;pected, to
enable me to acquire re&#383;pect. I was an
egg dropped on the &#383;and; a pauper by
nature, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hunted'">&#383;hunted</ins> from family to family,
who belonged to nobody&mdash;and nobody
cared for me. I was de&#383;pi&#383;ed from my
birth, and denied the chance of obtaining
a footing for my&#383;elf in &#383;ociety. Yes;
I had not even the chance of being
con&#383;idered as a fellow-creature&mdash;yet all
the people with whom I lived, brutalized
as they were by the low cunning
of trade, and the de&#383;picable &#383;hifts of
poverty, were not without bowels,
though they never yearned for me. I
was, in fact, born a &#383;lave, and chained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-91_S" id="Pg_1-91_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-91.png">91</a>]</span>
by infamy to &#383;lavery during the whole
of exi&#383;tence, without having any companions
to alleviate it by &#383;ympathy, or
teach me how to ri&#383;e above it by their
example. But, to re&#383;ume the thread of
my tale&mdash;</p>

<p>"At &#383;ixteen, I &#383;uddenly grew tall,
and &#383;omething like comeline&#383;s appeared
on a Sunday, when I had time to wa&#383;h
my face, and put on clean clothes. My
ma&#383;ter had once or twice caught hold
of me in the pa&#383;&#383;age; but I in&#383;tinctively
avoided his di&#383;gu&#383;ting care&#383;&#383;es. One
day however, when the family were
at a methodi&#383;t meeting, he contrived to
be alone in the hou&#383;e with me, and by
blows&mdash;yes; blows and menaces, compelled
me to &#383;ubmit to his ferocious
de&#383;ire; and, to avoid my mi&#383;tre&#383;s's
fury, I was obliged in future to comply,
and &#383;kulk to my loft at his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-92_S" id="Pg_1-92_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-92.png">92</a>]</span>mand,
in &#383;pite of increa&#383;ing loathing.</p>

<p>"The angui&#383;h which was now pent
up in my bo&#383;om, &#383;eemed to open a new
world to me: I began to extend my
thoughts beyond my&#383;elf, and grieve
for human mi&#383;ery, till I di&#383;covered,
with horror&mdash;ah! what horror!&mdash;that I
was with child. I know not why I felt
a mixed &#383;en&#383;ation of de&#383;pair and tenderne&#383;s,
excepting that, ever called a
ba&#383;tard, a ba&#383;tard appeared to me an
object of the greate&#383;t compa&#383;&#383;ion in
creation.</p>

<p>"I communicated this dreadful circum&#383;tance
to my ma&#383;ter, who was almo&#383;t
equally alarmed at the intelligence;
for he feared his wife, and public
cen&#383;ure at the meeting. After &#383;ome
weeks of deliberation had elap&#383;ed, I in
continual fear that my altered &#383;hape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-93_S" id="Pg_1-93_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-93.png">93</a>]</span>
would be noticed, my ma&#383;ter gave me
a medicine in a phial, which he de&#383;ired
me to take, telling me, without any
circumlocution, for what purpo&#383;e it
was de&#383;igned. I bur&#383;t into tears, I
thought it was killing my&#383;elf&mdash;yet was
&#383;uch a &#383;elf as I worth pre&#383;erving? He
cur&#383;ed me for a fool, and left me to my
own reflections. I could not re&#383;olve to
take this infernal potion; but I wrapped
it up in an old gown, and hid it
in a corner of my box.</p>

<p>"Nobody yet &#383;u&#383;pected me, becau&#383;e
they had been accu&#383;tomed to view me
as a creature of another &#383;pecies. But
the threatening &#383;torm at la&#383;t broke over
my devoted head&mdash;never &#383;hall I forget
it! One Sunday evening when I was
left, as u&#383;ual, to take care of the hou&#383;e,
my ma&#383;ter came home intoxicated, and
I became the prey of his brutal appe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-94_S" id="Pg_1-94_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-94.png">94</a>]</span>tite.
His extreme intoxication made
him forget his cu&#383;tomary caution, and
my mi&#383;tre&#383;s entered and found us in a
&#383;ituation that could not have been more
hateful to her than me. Her hu&#383;band
was 'pot-valiant,' he feared her not
at the moment, nor had he then much
rea&#383;on, for &#383;he in&#383;tantly turned the
whole force of her anger another
way. She tore off my cap, &#383;cratched,
kicked, and buffetted me, till &#383;he had
exhau&#383;ted her &#383;trength, declaring, as &#383;he
re&#383;ted her arm, 'that I had wheedled
her hu&#383;band from her.&mdash;But, could any
thing better be expected from a wretch,
whom &#383;he had taken into her hou&#383;e out
of pure charity?' What a torrent of
abu&#383;e ru&#383;hed out? till, almo&#383;t breathle&#383;s,
&#383;he concluded with &#383;aying, 'that I
was born a &#383;trumpet; it ran in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-95_S" id="Pg_1-95_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-95.png">95</a>]</span>
blood, and nothing good could come
to tho&#383;e who harboured me.'</p>

<p>"My &#383;ituation was, of cour&#383;e, di&#383;covered,
and &#383;he declared that I &#383;hould
not &#383;tay another night under the &#383;ame
roof with an hone&#383;t family. I was
therefore pu&#383;hed out of doors, and my
trumpery thrown after me, when it had
been contemptuou&#383;ly examined in the
pa&#383;&#383;age, le&#383;t I &#383;hould have &#383;tolen any
thing.</p>

<p>"Behold me then in the &#383;treet, utterly
de&#383;titute! Whither could I creep for
&#383;helter? To my father's roof I had no
claim, when not pur&#383;ued by &#383;hame&mdash;now
I &#383;hrunk back as from death, from
my mother's cruel reproaches, my father's
execrations. I could not endure
to hear him cur&#383;e the day I was born,
though life had been a cur&#383;e to me. Of
death I thought, but with a confu&#383;ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-96_S" id="Pg_1-96_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-96.png">96</a>]</span>
emotion of terror, as I &#383;tood leaning
my head on a po&#383;t, and &#383;tarting at every
foot&#383;tep, le&#383;t it &#383;hould be my mi&#383;tre&#383;s
coming to tear my heart out. One of
the boys of the &#383;hop pa&#383;&#383;ing by, heard
my tale, and immediately repaired to
his ma&#383;ter, to give him a de&#383;cription of
my &#383;ituation; and he touched the right
key&mdash;the &#383;candal it would give ri&#383;e to,
if I were left to repeat my tale to every
enquirer. This plea came home to his
rea&#383;on, who had been &#383;obered by his
wife's rage, the fury of which fell on
him when I was out of her reach, and
he &#383;ent the boy to me with half-a-guinea,
de&#383;iring him to conduct me to a
hou&#383;e, where beggars, and other
wretches, the refu&#383;e of &#383;ociety, nightly
lodged.</p>

<p>"This night was &#383;pent in a &#383;tate of
&#383;tupefaction, or de&#383;peration. I dete&#383;ted
mankind, and abhorred my&#383;elf.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-97_S" id="Pg_1-97_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-97.png">97</a>]</span>
"In the morning I ventured out, to
throw my&#383;elf in my ma&#383;ter's way, at his
u&#383;ual hour of going abroad. I approached
him, he 'damned me for a
b&mdash;&mdash;, declared I had di&#383;turbed the
peace of the family, and that he had
&#383;worn to his wife, never to take any
more notice of me.' He left me; but,
in&#383;tantly returning, he told me that he
&#383;hould &#383;peak to his friend, a pari&#383;h-officer,
to get a nur&#383;e for the brat I laid
to him; and advi&#383;ed me, if I wi&#383;hed to
keep out of the hou&#383;e of correction, not
to make free with his name.</p>

<p>"I hurried back to my hole, and, rage
giving place to de&#383;pair, &#383;ought for the
potion that was to procure abortion, and
&#383;wallowed it, with a wi&#383;h that it might
de&#383;troy me, at the &#383;ame time that it
&#383;topped the &#383;en&#383;ations of new-born life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-98_S" id="Pg_1-98_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-98.png">98</a>]</span>
which I felt with inde&#383;cribable emotion.
My head turned round, my heart grew
&#383;ick, and in the horrors of approaching
di&#383;&#383;olution, mental angui&#383;h was &#383;wallowed
up. The effect of the medicine
was violent, and I was confined to my
bed &#383;everal days; but, youth and a
&#383;trong con&#383;titution prevailing, I once
more crawled out, to a&#383;k my&#383;elf the
cruel que&#383;tion, 'Whither I &#383;hould
go?' I had but two &#383;hillings left in
my pocket, the re&#383;t had been expended,
by a poor woman who &#383;lept in the
&#383;ame room, to pay for my lodging,
and purcha&#383;e the nece&#383;&#383;aries of which
&#383;he partook.</p>

<p>"With this wretch I went into the
neighbouring &#383;treets to beg, and my
di&#383;con&#383;olate appearance drew a few
pence from the idle, enabling me &#383;till
to command a bed; till, recovering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-99_S" id="Pg_1-99_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-99.png">99</a>]</span>
from my illne&#383;s, and taught to put on
my rags to the be&#383;t advantage, I was
acco&#383;ted from different motives, and
yielded to the de&#383;ire of the brutes I met,
with the &#383;ame dete&#383;tation that I had
felt for my &#383;till more brutal ma&#383;ter.
I have &#383;ince read in novels of the blandi&#383;hments
of &#383;eduction, but I had not
even the plea&#383;ure of being enticed
into vice.</p>

<p>"I &#383;hall not," interrupted Jemima,
"lead your imagination into all the
&#383;cenes of wretchedne&#383;s and depravity,
which I was condemned to view; or
mark the different &#383;tages of my deba&#383;ing
mi&#383;ery. Fate dragged me
through the very kennels of &#383;ociety;
I was &#383;till a &#383;lave, a ba&#383;tard, a common
property. Become familiar with vice,
for I wi&#383;h to conceal nothing from you,
I picked the pockets of the drunkards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-100_S" id="Pg_1-100_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-100.png">100</a>]</span>
who abu&#383;ed me; and proved by my
conduct, that I de&#383;erved the epithets,
with which they loaded me at moments
when di&#383;tru&#383;t ought to cea&#383;e.</p>

<p>"Dete&#383;ting my nightly occupation,
though valuing, if I may &#383;o u&#383;e the
word, my independence, which only
con&#383;i&#383;ted in choo&#383;ing the &#383;treet in which
I &#383;hould wander, or the roof, when I
had money, in which I &#383;hould hide my
head, I was &#383;ome time before I could
prevail on my&#383;elf to accept of a place
in a hou&#383;e of ill fame, to which a girl,
with whom I had accidentally conver&#383;ed
in the &#383;treet, had recommended
me. I had been hunted almo&#383;t into a
a fever, by the watchmen of the quarter
of the town I frequented; one,
whom I had unwittingly offended, giving
the word to the whole pack. You
can &#383;carcely conceive the tyranny ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-101_S" id="Pg_1-101_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-101.png">101</a>]</span>erci&#383;ed
by the&#383;e wretches: con&#383;idering
them&#383;elves as the in&#383;truments of
the very laws they violate, the pretext
which &#383;teels their con&#383;cience, hardens
their heart. Not content with receiving
from us, outlaws of &#383;ociety (let
other women talk of favours) a brutal
gratification gratuitou&#383;ly as a privilege
of office, they extort a tithe of pro&#383;titution,
and harra&#383;s with threats the
poor creatures who&#383;e occupation affords
not the means to &#383;ilence the growl of
avarice. To e&#383;cape from this per&#383;ecution,
I once more entered into &#383;ervitude.</p>

<p>"A life of comparative regularity
re&#383;tored my health; and&mdash;do not &#383;tart&mdash;my
manners were improved, in a &#383;ituation
where vice &#383;ought to render it&#383;elf
alluring, and ta&#383;te was cultivated to
fa&#383;hion the per&#383;on, if not to refine the
mind. Be&#383;ides, the common civility of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-102_S" id="Pg_1-102_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-102.png">102</a>]</span>
&#383;peech, contra&#383;ted with the gro&#383;s vulgarity
to which I had been accu&#383;tomed,
was &#383;omething like the poli&#383;h of civilization.
I was not &#383;hut out from all intercour&#383;e
of humanity. Still I was galled
by the yoke of &#383;ervice, and my mi&#383;tre&#383;s
often flying into violent fits of pa&#383;&#383;ion,
made me dread a &#383;udden di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ion,
which I under&#383;tood was always the
ca&#383;e. I was therefore prevailed on,
though I felt a horror of men, to accept
the offer of a gentleman, rather in the
decline of years, to keep his hou&#383;e,
plea&#383;antly &#383;ituated in a little village
near Hamp&#383;tead.</p>

<p>"He was a man of great talents, and
of brilliant wit; but, a worn-out votary
of voluptuou&#383;ne&#383;s, his de&#383;ires became
fa&#383;tidious in proportion as they
grew weak, and the native tenderne&#383;s
of his heart was undermined by a vi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-103_S" id="Pg_1-103_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-103.png">103</a>]</span>tiated

of libertini&#383;m and &#383;ocial enjoyment,
had injured his health to &#383;uch a
degree, that, whatever plea&#383;ure his conver&#383;ation
afforded me (and my e&#383;teem
was en&#383;ured by proofs of the generous
humanity of his di&#383;po&#383;ition), the being
his mi&#383;tre&#383;s was purcha&#383;ing it at a very
dear rate. With &#383;uch a keen perception
of the delicacies of &#383;entiment,
with an imagination invigorated by
the exerci&#383;e of genius, how could he
&#383;ink into the gro&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s of &#383;en&#383;uality!</p>

<p>"But, to pa&#383;s over a &#383;ubject which I

language were &#383;uperior to my &#383;tation?'
that I now began to read, to beguile
the tediou&#383;ne&#383;s of &#383;olitude, and to
gratify an inqui&#383;itive, active mind. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-104_S" id="Pg_1-104_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-104.png">104</a>]</span>

puni&#383;hed for delaying to return
with whatever I was &#383;ent to purcha&#383;e. I
could ju&#383;t &#383;pell and put a &#383;entence together,
and I li&#383;tened to the various arguments,
though often mingled with
ob&#383;cenity, which occurred at the table
where I was allowed to pre&#383;ide: for a
literary friend or two frequently came
home with my ma&#383;ter, to dine and pa&#383;s
the night. Having lo&#383;t the privileged re&#383;pect
of my &#383;ex, my pre&#383;ence, in&#383;tead
of re&#383;training, perhaps gave the reins
to their tongues; &#383;till I had the advantage
of hearing di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ions, from which,
in the common cour&#383;e of life, women
are excluded.</p>

and my ma&#383;ter occa&#383;ionally
&#383;hutting him&#383;elf up in this retreat, for
weeks together, to write, I had many
opportunities of improvement. At

I began to have the ambition of
returning to the re&#383;pectable part of &#383;ociety,

<p>"I &#383;hould have di&#383;tingui&#383;hed this as
a moment of &#383;un&#383;hine, a happy period
in my life, had not the repugnance the
di&#383;gu&#383;ting libertini&#383;m of my protector<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-107_S" id="Pg_1-107_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-107.png">107</a>]</span>
in&#383;pired, daily become more painful.&mdash;And,
indeed, I &#383;oon did recollect it as
&#383;uch with agony, when his &#383;udden
death (for he had recour&#383;e to the mo&#383;t
exhilarating cordials to keep up the
convivial tone of his &#383;pirits) again
threw me into the de&#383;ert of human &#383;ociety.
Had he had any time for reflection,
I am certain he would have
left the little property in his power to
me: but, attacked by the fatal apoplexy
in town, his heir, a man of
rigid morals, brought his wife with
him to take po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of the hou&#383;e and
effects, before I was even informed of
his death,&mdash;'to prevent,' as &#383;he took
care indirectly to tell me, '&#383;uch a
creature as &#383;he &#383;uppo&#383;ed me to be, from
purloining any of them, had I been
apprized of the event in time.'</p>

<p>"The grief I felt at the &#383;udden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-108_S" id="Pg_1-108_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-108.png">108</a>]</span>
&#383;hock the information gave me, which
at fir&#383;t had nothing &#383;elfi&#383;h in it, was
treated with contempt, and I was ordered
to pack up my clothes; and a few
trinkets and books, given me by the
generous decea&#383;ed, were conte&#383;ted,
while they piou&#383;ly hoped, with a reprobating
&#383;hake of the head, 'that
God would have mercy on his &#383;inful
&#383;oul!' With &#383;ome difficulty, I obtained
my arrears of wages; but a&#383;king&mdash;&#383;uch
is the &#383;pirit-grinding con&#383;equence
of poverty and infamy&mdash;for a character
for hone&#383;ty and economy, which God
knows I merited, I was told by this&mdash;why
mu&#383;t I call her woman?&mdash;'that
it would go again&#383;t her con&#383;cience to
recommend a kept mi&#383;tre&#383;s.' Tears
&#383;tarted in my eyes, burning tears; for
there are &#383;ituations in which a wretch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-109_S" id="Pg_1-109_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-109.png">109</a>]</span>
is humbled by the contempt they are
con&#383;cious they do not de&#383;erve.</p>

<p>"I returned to the metropolis; but
the &#383;olitude of a poor lodging was inconceivably
dreary, after the &#383;ociety I
had enjoyed. To be cut off from human
conver&#383;e, now I had been taught
to reli&#383;h it, was to wander a gho&#383;t
among the living. Be&#383;ides, I fore&#383;aw, to
aggravate the &#383;everity of my fate, that
my little pittance would &#383;oon melt
away. I endeavoured to obtain needlework;
but, not having been taught early,
and my hands being rendered clum&#383;y
by hard work, I did not &#383;ufficiently excel
to be employed by the ready-made
linen &#383;hops, when &#383;o many women,
better qualified, were &#383;uing for it.
The want of a character prevented my
getting a place; for, irk&#383;ome as &#383;ervitude
would have been to me, I &#383;hould<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-110_S" id="Pg_1-110_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-110.png">110</a>]</span>
have made another trial, had it been
fea&#383;ible. Not that I di&#383;liked employment,
but the inequality of condition
to which I mu&#383;t have &#383;ubmitted.
I had acquired a ta&#383;te for literature,
during the five years I had lived with
a literary man, occa&#383;ionally conver&#383;ing
with men of the fir&#383;t abilities of the
age; and now to de&#383;cend to the lowe&#383;t
vulgarity, was a degree of wretchedne&#383;s
not to be imagined unfelt. I had
not, it is true, ta&#383;ted the charms of affection,
but I had been familiar with
the graces of humanity.</p>

<p>"One of the gentlemen, whom I
had frequently dined in company with,
while I was treated like a companion,
met me in the &#383;treet, and enquired
after my health. I &#383;eized the occa&#383;ion,
and began to de&#383;cribe my &#383;ituation;
but he was in ha&#383;te to join, at dinner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-111_S" id="Pg_1-111_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-111.png">111</a>]</span>
a &#383;elect party of choice &#383;pirits; therefore,
without waiting to hear me, he
impatiently put a guinea into my hand,
&#383;aying, 'It was a pity &#383;uch a &#383;en&#383;ible
woman &#383;hould be in di&#383;tre&#383;s&mdash;he wi&#383;hed
me well from his &#383;oul.'</p>

<p>"To another I wrote, &#383;tating my ca&#383;e,
and reque&#383;ting advice. He was an advocate
for unequivocal &#383;incerity; and
had often, in my pre&#383;ence, de&#383;canted
on the evils which ari&#383;e in &#383;ociety from
the de&#383;poti&#383;m of rank and riches.</p>

<p>"In reply, I received a long e&#383;&#383;ay on
the energy of the human mind, with
continual allu&#383;ions to his own force of
character. He added, 'That the woman
who could write &#383;uch a letter as I
had &#383;ent him, could never be in want
of re&#383;ources, were &#383;he to look into her&#383;elf,
and exert her powers; mi&#383;ery was
the con&#383;equence of indolence, and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-112_S" id="Pg_1-112_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-112.png">112</a>]</span>
to my being &#383;hut out from &#383;ociety, it
was the lot of man to &#383;ubmit to certain
privations.'</p>

<p>"How often have I heard," &#383;aid
Jemima, interrupting her narrative,
"in conver&#383;ation, and read in books,
that every per&#383;on willing to work may
find employment? It is the vague a&#383;&#383;ertion,
I believe, of in&#383;en&#383;ible indolence,
when it relates to men; but, with
re&#383;pect to women, I am &#383;ure of its fallacy,
unle&#383;s they will &#383;ubmit to the
mo&#383;t menial bodily labour; and even
to be employed at hard labour is out of
the reach of many, who&#383;e reputation
mi&#383;fortune or folly has tainted.</p>

<p>"How writers, profe&#383;&#383;ing to be friends
to freedom, and the improvement of
morals, can a&#383;&#383;ert that poverty is no
evil, I cannot imagine."</p>

<p>"No more can I," interrupted Ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-113_S" id="Pg_1-113_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-113.png">113</a>]</span>ria,
"yet they even expatiate on the
peculiar happine&#383;s of indigence, though
in what it can con&#383;i&#383;t, excepting in
brutal re&#383;t, when a man can barely earn
a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, I cannot imagine. The
mind is nece&#383;&#383;arily impri&#383;oned in its
own little tenement; and, fully occupied
by keeping it in repair, has not
time to rove abroad for improvement.
The book of knowledge is clo&#383;ely
cla&#383;ped, again&#383;t tho&#383;e who mu&#383;t fulfil
their daily ta&#383;k of &#383;evere manual labour
or die; and curio&#383;ity, rarely excited by
thought or information, &#383;eldom moves
on the &#383;tagnate lake of ignorance."</p>

<p>"As far as I have been able to ob&#383;erve,"
replied Jemima, "prejudices,
caught up by chance, are ob&#383;tinately
maintained by the poor, to the exclu&#383;ion
of improvement; they have not
time to rea&#383;on or reflect to any extent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-114_S" id="Pg_1-114_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-114.png">114</a>]</span>
or minds &#383;ufficiently exerci&#383;ed to adopt
the principles of action, which form
perhaps the only ba&#383;is of contentment
in every &#383;tation<a name="FNanchor_114-A_5_S" id="FNanchor_114-A_5_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_114-A_5_S" class="fnanchor">[114-A]</a>."</p>

<hr />

<p>"And independence," &#383;aid Darnford,
"they are nece&#383;&#383;arily &#383;trangers to,
even the independence of de&#383;pi&#383;ing their
per&#383;ecutors. If the poor are happy, or
can be happy, <i>things are very well as they
are</i>. And I cannot conceive on what
principle tho&#383;e writers contend for a
change of &#383;y&#383;tem, who &#383;upport this
opinion. The authors on the other
&#383;ide of the que&#383;tion are much more
con&#383;i&#383;tent, who grant the fact; yet, in&#383;i&#383;ting
that it is the lot of the majority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-115_S" id="Pg_1-115_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-115.png">115</a>]</span>
to be oppre&#383;&#383;ed in this life, kindly turn
them over to another, to rectify the
fal&#383;e weights and mea&#383;ures of this, as
the only way to ju&#383;tify the di&#383;pen&#383;ations
of Providence. I have not," continued
Darnford, "an opinion more firmly
fixed by ob&#383;ervation in my mind, than
that, though riches may fail to produce
proportionate happine&#383;s, poverty mo&#383;t
commonly excludes it, by &#383;hutting up
all the avenues to improvement."</p>

<p>"And as for the affections," added
Maria, with a &#383;igh, "how gro&#383;s, and
even tormenting do they become, unle&#383;s
regulated by an improving mind!
The culture of the heart ever, I believe,
keeps pace with that of the
mind. But pray go on," addre&#383;&#383;ing
Jemima, "though your narrative gives
ri&#383;e to the mo&#383;t painful reflections on
the pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of &#383;ociety."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-116_S" id="Pg_1-116_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-116.png">116</a>]</span>
"Not to trouble you," continued
&#383;he, "with a detailed de&#383;cription of all
the painful feelings of unavailing exertion,
I have only to tell you, that at
la&#383;t I got recommended to wa&#383;h in a
few families, who did me the favour
to admit me into their hou&#383;es, without
the mo&#383;t &#383;trict enquiry, to wa&#383;h from
one in the morning till eight at night,
for eighteen or twenty-pence a day.
On the happine&#383;s to be enjoyed over a
wa&#383;hing-tub I need not comment; yet
you will allow me to ob&#383;erve, that this
was a wretchedne&#383;s of &#383;ituation peculiar
to my &#383;ex. A man with half my indu&#383;try,
and, I may &#383;ay, abilities, could
have procured a decent livelihood, and
di&#383;charged &#383;ome of the duties which
knit mankind together; whil&#383;t I, who
had acquired a ta&#383;te for the rational, nay,
in hone&#383;t pride let me a&#383;&#383;ert it, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-117_S" id="Pg_1-117_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-117.png">117</a>]</span>
virtuous enjoyments of life, was ca&#383;t
a&#383;ide as the filth of &#383;ociety. Condemned
to labour, like a machine, only
to earn bread, and &#383;carcely that, I became
melancholy and de&#383;perate.</p>

<p>"I have now to mention a circum&#383;tance
which fills me with remor&#383;e, and
fear it will entirely deprive me of your
e&#383;teem. A trade&#383;man became attached
to me, and vi&#383;ited me frequently,&mdash;and
I at la&#383;t obtained &#383;uch a power over
him, that he offered to take me home
to his hou&#383;e.&mdash;Con&#383;ider, dear madam,
I was fami&#383;hing: wonder not that I became
a wolf!&mdash;The only rea&#383;on for not
taking me home immediately, was the
having a girl in the hou&#383;e, with child
by him&mdash;and this girl&mdash;I advi&#383;ed him&mdash;yes,
I did! would I could forget it!&mdash;to
turn out of doors: and one night he
determined to follow my advice, Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-118_S" id="Pg_1-118_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-118.png">118</a>]</span>
wretch! &#383;he fell upon her knees, reminded
him that he had promi&#383;ed to
marry her, that her parents were hone&#383;t!&mdash;What
did it avail?&mdash;She was turned
out.</p>

<p>"She approached her father's door,
in the &#383;kirts of London,&mdash;li&#383;tened at
the &#383;hutters,&mdash;but could not knock. A
watchman had ob&#383;erved her go and
return &#383;everal times&mdash;Poor wretch!&mdash;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads '['">"</ins> The
remor&#383;e Jemima &#383;poke of, &#383;eemed
to be &#383;tinging her to the &#383;oul, as &#383;he
proceeded.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads ']'">"</ins></p>

<p>"She left it, and, approaching a
tub where hor&#383;es were watered, &#383;he
&#383;at down in it, and, with de&#383;perate re&#383;olution,
remained in that attitude&mdash;till
re&#383;olution was no longer nece&#383;&#383;ary!</p>

<p>"I happened that morning to be
going out to wa&#383;h, anticipating the
moment when I &#383;hould e&#383;cape from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-119_S" id="Pg_1-119_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-119.png">119</a>]</span>
&#383;uch hard labour. I pa&#383;&#383;ed by, ju&#383;t as
&#383;ome men, going to work, drew out
the &#383;tiff, cold corp&#383;e&mdash;Let me not recal
the horrid moment!&mdash;I recognized
her pale vi&#383;age; I li&#383;tened to the tale
told by the &#383;pectators, and my heart
did not bur&#383;t. I thought of my own
&#383;tate, and wondered how I could be
&#383;uch a mon&#383;ter!&mdash;I worked hard; and,
returning home, I was attacked by a
fever. I &#383;uffered both in body and mind.
I determined not to live with the
wretch. But he did not try me; he
left the neighbourhood. I once more
returned to the wa&#383;h-tub.</p>

<p>"Still this &#383;tate, mi&#383;erable as it was,
admitted of aggravation. Lifting one
day a heavy load, a tub fell again&#383;t my
&#383;hin, and gave me great pain. I did
not pay much attention to the hurt,
till it became a &#383;erious wound; being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-120_S" id="Pg_1-120_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-120.png">120</a>]</span>
obliged to work as u&#383;ual, or &#383;tarve.
But, finding my&#383;elf at length unable
to &#383;tand for any time, I thought of
getting into an ho&#383;pital. Ho&#383;pitals, it
&#383;hould &#383;eem (for they are comfortle&#383;s
abodes for the &#383;ick) were expre&#383;&#383;ly endowed
for the reception of the friendle&#383;s;
yet I, who had on that plea a
right to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance, wanted the recommendation
of the rich and re&#383;pectable,
and was &#383;everal weeks langui&#383;hing for admittance;
fees were demanded on entering;
and, what was &#383;till more unrea&#383;onable,
&#383;ecurity for burying me, that expence
not coming into the letter of the
charity. A guinea was the &#383;tipulated &#383;um&mdash;I
could as &#383;oon have rai&#383;ed a million;
and I was afraid to apply to the pari&#383;h
for an order, le&#383;t they &#383;hould have
pa&#383;&#383;ed me, I knew not whither. The
poor woman at who&#383;e hou&#383;e I lodged,
compa&#383;&#383;ionating my &#383;tate, got me into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-121_S" id="Pg_1-121_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-121.png">121</a>]</span>
the ho&#383;pital; and the family where I
received the hurt, &#383;ent me five &#383;hillings,
three and &#383;ix-pence of which I gave at
my admittance&mdash;I know not for what.</p>

<p>"My leg grew quickly better; but
I was di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ed before my cure was
completed, becau&#383;e I could not afford
to have my linen wa&#383;hed to appear decently,
as the virago of a nur&#383;e &#383;aid,
when the gentlemen (the &#383;urgeons)
came. I cannot give you an adequate
idea of the wretchedne&#383;s of an ho&#383;pital;
every thing is left to the care of people
intent on gain. The attendants &#383;eem
to have lo&#383;t all feeling of compa&#383;&#383;ion in
the bu&#383;tling di&#383;charge of their offices;
death is &#383;o familiar to them, that they
are not anxious to ward it off. Every
thing appeared to be conducted for the
accommodation of the medical men
and their pupils, who came to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-122_S" id="Pg_1-122_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-122.png">122</a>]</span>
experiments on the poor, for the benefit
of the rich. One of the phy&#383;icians,
I mu&#383;t not forget to mention, gave me
half-a-crown, and ordered me &#383;ome
wine, when I was at the lowe&#383;t ebb. I
thought of making my ca&#383;e known to
the lady-like matron; but her forbidding
countenance prevented me. She
conde&#383;cended to look on the patients,
and make general enquiries, two or
three times a week; but the nur&#383;es
knew the hour when the vi&#383;it of ceremony
would commence, and every
thing was as it &#383;hould be.</p>

<p>"After my di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ion, I was more at
a lo&#383;s than ever for a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, and,
not to weary you with a repetition of
the &#383;ame unavailing attempts, unable
to &#383;tand at the wa&#383;hing-tub, I began to
con&#383;ider the rich and poor as natural
enemies, and became a thief from prin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-123_S" id="Pg_1-123_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-123.png">123</a>]</span>ciple.
I could not now cea&#383;e to rea&#383;on,
but I hated mankind. I de&#383;pi&#383;ed my&#383;elf,
yet I ju&#383;tified my conduct. I was
taken, tried, and condemned to &#383;ix
months' impri&#383;onment in a hou&#383;e of
correction. My &#383;oul recoils with horror
from the remembrance of the in&#383;ults I
had to endure, till, branded with &#383;hame,
I was turned loo&#383;e in the &#383;treet, pennyle&#383;s.
I wandered from &#383;treet to &#383;treet,
till, exhau&#383;ted by hunger and fatigue, I
&#383;unk down &#383;en&#383;ele&#383;s at a door, where
I had vainly demanded a mor&#383;el of
bread. I was &#383;ent by the inhabitant to
the work-hou&#383;e, to which he had &#383;urlily
bid me go, &#383;aying, he 'paid enough
in con&#383;cience to the poor,' when, with
parched tongue, I implored his charity.
If tho&#383;e well-meaning people who exclaim
again&#383;t beggars, were acquainted
with the treatment the poor receive in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-124_S" id="Pg_1-124_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-124.png">124</a>]</span>
many of the&#383;e wretched a&#383;ylums, they
would not &#383;tifle &#383;o ea&#383;ily involuntary
&#383;ympathy, by &#383;aying that they have all
pari&#383;hes to go to, or wonder that the
poor dread to enter the gloomy walls.
What are the common run of work-hou&#383;es,
but pri&#383;ons, in which many
re&#383;pectable old people, worn out by
immoderate labour, &#383;ink into the grave
in &#383;orrow, to which they are carried
like dogs!"</p>

<p>Alarmed by &#383;ome indi&#383;tinct noi&#383;e,
Jemima ro&#383;e ha&#383;tily to li&#383;ten, and Maria,
turning to Darnford, &#383;aid, "I have indeed
been &#383;hocked beyond expre&#383;&#383;ion
when I have met a pauper's funeral. A
coffin carried on the &#383;houlders of three
or four ill-looking wretches, whom the
imagination might ea&#383;ily convert into a
band of a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins, ha&#383;tening to conceal
the corp&#383;e, and quarrelling about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-125_S" id="Pg_1-125_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-125.png">125</a>]</span>
prey on their way. I know it is of
little con&#383;equence how we are con&#383;igned
to the earth; but I am led by
this brutal in&#383;en&#383;ibility, to what even
the animal creation appears forcibly to
feel, to advert to the wretched, de&#383;erted
manner in which they died."</p>

<p>"True," rejoined Darnford, "and,
till the rich will give more than a part
of their wealth, till they will give time
and attention to the wants of the di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed,
never let them boa&#383;t of charity.
Let them open their hearts, and not
their pur&#383;es, and employ their minds
in the &#383;ervice, if they are really actuated
by humanity; or charitable in&#383;titutions
will always be the prey of the
lowe&#383;t order of knaves."</p>

<p>Jemima returning, &#383;eemed in ha&#383;te
to fini&#383;h her tale. "The over&#383;eer
farmed the poor of different pari&#383;hes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-126_S" id="Pg_1-126_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-126.png">126</a>]</span>
and out of the bowels of poverty was
wrung the money with which he purcha&#383;ed
this dwelling, as a private receptacle
for madne&#383;s. He had been
a keeper at a hou&#383;e of the &#383;ame de&#383;cription,
and conceived that he could
make money much more readily in his
old occupation. He is a &#383;hrewd&mdash;&#383;hall
I &#383;ay it?&mdash;villain. He ob&#383;erved &#383;omething
re&#383;olute in my manner, and offered
to take me with him, and in&#383;truct
me how to treat the di&#383;turbed minds he
meant to intru&#383;t to my care. The
offer of forty pounds a year, and to quit
a workhou&#383;e, was not to be de&#383;pi&#383;ed,
though the condition of &#383;hutting my
eyes and hardening my heart was annexed
to it.</p>

<p>"I agreed to accompany him; and
four years have I been attendant on
many wretches, and"&mdash;&#383;he lowered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-127_S" id="Pg_1-127_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-127.png">127</a>]</span>
her voice,&mdash;"the witne&#383;s of many
enormities. In &#383;olitude my mind
&#383;eemed to recover its force, and many
of the &#383;entiments which I imbibed in
the only tolerable period of my life, returned
with their full force. Still
what &#383;hould induce me to be the champion
for &#383;uffering humanity?&mdash;Who
ever ri&#383;ked any thing for me?&mdash;Who
ever acknowledged me to be a fellow-creature?"&mdash;</p>

<p>Maria took her hand, and Jemima,
more overcome by kindne&#383;s than &#383;he
had ever been by cruelty, ha&#383;tened out
of the room to conceal her emotions.</p>

<p>Darnford &#383;oon after heard his &#383;ummons,
and, taking leave of him, Maria
promi&#383;ed to gratify his curio&#383;ity,
with re&#383;pect to her&#383;elf, the fir&#383;t
opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Active</span> as love was in the heart
of Maria, the &#383;tory &#383;he had ju&#383;t heard
made her thoughts take a wider range.
The opening buds of hope clo&#383;ed, as
if they had put forth too early, and the
the happie&#383;t day of her life was overca&#383;t
by the mo&#383;t melancholy reflections.
Thinking of Jemima's peculiar fate
and her own, &#383;he was led to con&#383;ider
the oppre&#383;&#383;ed &#383;tate of women, and to
lament that &#383;he had given birth to a
daughter. Sleep fled from her eyelids,
while &#383;he dwelt on the wretchedne&#383;s
of unprotected infancy, till &#383;ympathy
with Jemima changed to agony,
when it &#383;eemed probable that her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-129_S" id="Pg_1-129_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-129.png">129</a>]</span>
babe might even now be in the very
&#383;tate &#383;he &#383;o forcibly de&#383;cribed.</p>

<p>Maria thought, and thought again.
Jemima's humanity had rather been
benumbed than killed, by the keen
fro&#383;t &#383;he had to brave at her entrance
into life; an appeal then to her feelings,
on this tender point, &#383;urely
would not be fruitle&#383;s; and Maria began
to anticipate the delight it would
afford her to gain intelligence of her
child. This project was now the only
&#383;ubject of reflection; and &#383;he watched
impatiently for the dawn of day, with
that determinate purpo&#383;e which generally
in&#383;ures &#383;ucce&#383;s.</p>

<p>At the u&#383;ual hour, Jemima brought
her breakfa&#383;t, and a tender note from
Darnford. She ran her eye ha&#383;tily over
it, and her heart calmly hoarded up
the rapture a fre&#383;h a&#383;&#383;urance of affec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-130_S" id="Pg_1-130_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-130.png">130</a>]</span>tion,
affection &#383;uch as &#383;he wi&#383;hed to
in&#383;pire, gave her, without diverting her
mind a moment from its de&#383;ign. While
Jemima waited to take away the
breakfa&#383;t, Maria alluded to the reflections,
that had haunted her during the
night to the exclu&#383;ion of &#383;leep. She
&#383;poke with energy of Jemima's unmerited
&#383;ufferings, and of the fate of a
number of de&#383;erted females, placed
within the &#383;weep of a whirlwind, from
which it was next to impo&#383;&#383;ible to
e&#383;cape. Perceiving the effect her conver&#383;ation
produced on the countenance
of her guard, &#383;he gra&#383;ped the arm of
Jemima with that irre&#383;i&#383;tible warmth
which defies repul&#383;e, exclaiming&mdash;"With
your heart, and &#383;uch dreadful
experience, can you lend your aid to
deprive my babe of a mother's tenderne&#383;s,
a mother's care? In the name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-131_S" id="Pg_1-131_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-131.png">131</a>]</span>
of God, a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t me to &#383;natch her from
de&#383;truction! Let me but give her an
education&mdash;let me but prepare her
body and mind to encounter the ills
which await her &#383;ex, and I will teach
her to con&#383;ider you as her &#383;econd mother,
and her&#383;elf as the prop of your
age. Yes, Jemima, look at me&mdash;ob&#383;erve
me clo&#383;ely, and read my very &#383;oul;
you merit a better fate;" &#383;he held out
her hand with a firm ge&#383;ture of a&#383;&#383;urance;
"and I will procure it for you,
as a te&#383;timony of my e&#383;teem, as well as
of my gratitude."</p>

<p>Jemima had not power to re&#383;i&#383;t this
per&#383;ua&#383;ive torrent; and, owning that
the hou&#383;e in which &#383;he was confined,
was &#383;ituated on the banks of the
Thames, only a few miles from London,
and not on the &#383;ea-coa&#383;t, as Darnford
had &#383;uppo&#383;ed, &#383;he promi&#383;ed to in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-132_S" id="Pg_1-132_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-132.png">132</a>]</span>vent
&#383;ome excu&#383;e for her ab&#383;ence, and
go her&#383;elf to trace the &#383;ituation, and
enquire concerning the health, of this
abandoned daughter. Her manner
implied an intention to do &#383;omething
more, but &#383;he &#383;eemed unwilling to
impart her de&#383;ign; and Maria, glad to
have obtained the main point, thought
it be&#383;t to leave her to the workings of
her own mind; convinced that &#383;he had
the power of intere&#383;ting her &#383;till more
in favour of her&#383;elf and child, by a
&#383;imple recital of facts.</p>

<p>In the evening, Jemima informed the
impatient mother, that on the morrow
&#383;he &#383;hould ha&#383;ten to town before the family
hour of ri&#383;ing, and received all
the information nece&#383;&#383;ary, as a clue to
her &#383;earch. The "Good night!" Maria
uttered was peculiarly &#383;olemn and
affectionate. Glad expectation &#383;par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-133_S" id="Pg_1-133_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-133.png">133</a>]</span>kled
in her eye; and, for the fir&#383;t time
&#383;ince her detention, &#383;he pronounced
the name of her child with plea&#383;ureable
fondne&#383;s; and, with all the garrulity
of a nur&#383;e, de&#383;cribed her fir&#383;t
&#383;mile when &#383;he recognized her mother.
Recollecting her&#383;elf, a &#383;till
kinder "Adieu!" with a "God
ble&#383;s you!"&mdash;that &#383;eemed to include
a maternal benediction, di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ed
Jemima.</p>

<p>The dreary &#383;olitude of the en&#383;uing
day, lengthened by impatiently dwelling
on the &#383;ame idea, was intolerably
weari&#383;ome. She li&#383;tened for the &#383;ound
of a particular clock, which &#383;ome directions
of the wind allowed her to
hear di&#383;tinctly. She marked the &#383;hadow
gaining on the wall; and, twilight
thickening into darkne&#383;s, her breath
&#383;eemed oppre&#383;&#383;ed while &#383;he anxiou&#383;ly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-134_S" id="Pg_1-134_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-134.png">134</a>]</span>
counted nine.&mdash;The la&#383;t &#383;ound was a
&#383;troke of de&#383;pair on her heart; for &#383;he
expected every moment, without &#383;eeing
Jemima, to have her light extingui&#383;hed
by the &#383;avage female who &#383;upplied
her place. She was even obliged
to prepare for bed, re&#383;tle&#383;s as &#383;he was,
not to di&#383;oblige her new attendant.
She had been cautioned not to &#383;peak
too freely to her; but the caution was
needle&#383;s, her countenance would &#383;till
more emphatically have made her
&#383;hrink back. Such was the ferocity of
manner, con&#383;picuous in every word
and ge&#383;ture of this hag, that Maria was
afraid to enquire, why Jemima, who
had faithfully promi&#383;ed to &#383;ee her before
her door was &#383;hut for the night, came
not?&mdash;and, when the key turned in the
lock, to con&#383;ign her to a night of &#383;u&#383;pence,
&#383;he felt a degree of angui&#383;h<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-135_S" id="Pg_1-135_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-135.png">135</a>]</span>
which the circum&#383;tances &#383;carcely ju&#383;tified.</p>

<p>Continually on the watch, the &#383;hutting
of a door, or the &#383;ound of a foot&#383;tep,
made her &#383;tart and tremble with
apprehen&#383;ion, &#383;omething like what &#383;he
felt, when, at her entrance, dragged
along the gallery, &#383;he began to doubt
whether &#383;he were not &#383;urrounded by
demons?</p>

<p>Fatigued by an endle&#383;s rotation of
thought and wild alarms, &#383;he looked
like a &#383;pectre, when Jemima entered
in the morning; e&#383;pecially as her eyes
darted out of her head, to read in Jemima's
countenance, almo&#383;t as pallid,
the intelligence &#383;he dared not tru&#383;t her
tongue to demand. Jemima put down
the tea-things, and appeared very bu&#383;y
in arranging the table. Maria took up
a cup with trembling hand, then for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-136_S" id="Pg_1-136_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-136.png">136</a>]</span>cibly
recovering her fortitude, and re&#383;training
the convul&#383;ive movement
which agitated the mu&#383;cles of her
mouth, &#383;he &#383;aid, "Spare your&#383;elf the
pain of preparing me for your information,
I adjure you!&mdash;My child is dead!"
Jemima &#383;olemnly an&#383;wered, "Yes;"
with a look expre&#383;&#383;ive of compa&#383;&#383;ion
and angry emotions. "Leave me,"
added Maria, making a fre&#383;h effort to
govern her feelings, and hiding her face
in her handkerchief, to conceal her angui&#383;h&mdash;"It
is enough&mdash;I know that my
babe is no more&mdash;I will hear the particulars
when I am"&mdash;<i>calmer</i>, &#383;he could not
utter; and Jemima, without importuning
her by idle attempts to con&#383;ole her,
left the room.</p>

<p>Plunged in the deepe&#383;t melancholy,
&#383;he would not admit Darnford's vi&#383;its;
and &#383;uch is the force of early a&#383;&#383;ocia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-137_S" id="Pg_1-137_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-137.png">137</a>]</span>tions
even on &#383;trong minds, that, for
a while, &#383;he indulged the &#383;uper&#383;titious
notion that &#383;he was ju&#383;tly puni&#383;hed by
the death of her child, for having for an
in&#383;tant cea&#383;ed to regret her lo&#383;s. Two
or three letters from Darnford, full of
&#383;oothing, manly tenderne&#383;s, only added
poignancy to the&#383;e accu&#383;ing emotions;
yet the pa&#383;&#383;ionate &#383;tyle in which he expre&#383;&#383;ed,
what he termed the fir&#383;t and
fonde&#383;t wi&#383;h of his heart, "that his affection
might make her &#383;ome amends
for the cruelty and inju&#383;tice &#383;he had endured,"
in&#383;pired a &#383;entiment of gratitude
to heaven; and her eyes filled
with delicious tears, when, at the conclu&#383;ion
of his letter, wi&#383;hing to &#383;upply
the place of her unworthy relations,
who&#383;e want of principle he execrated,
he a&#383;&#383;ured her, calling her his deare&#383;t
girl, "that it &#383;hould henceforth be the
bu&#383;ine&#383;s of his life to make her happy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-138_S" id="Pg_1-138_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-138.png">138</a>]</span>
He begged, in a note &#383;ent the following
morning, to be permitted to &#383;ee
her, when his pre&#383;ence would be no intru&#383;ion
on her grief; and &#383;o earne&#383;tly
intreated to be allowed, according to
promi&#383;e, to beguile the tedious moments
of ab&#383;ence, by dwelling on the
events of her pa&#383;t life, that &#383;he &#383;ent him

<p>"Born in one of the mo&#383;t romantic
parts of England, an enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic fondne&#383;s
for the varying charms of nature
is the fir&#383;t &#383;entiment I recollect; or rather
it was the fir&#383;t con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of
plea&#383;ure that employed and formed my
imagination.</p>

<p>"My father had been a captain
of a man of war; but, di&#383;gu&#383;ted with
the &#383;ervice, on account of the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-142_S" id="Pg_1-142_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-142.png">142</a>]</span>ferment
of men who&#383;e chief merit was
their family connections or borough
intere&#383;t, he retired into the country;
and, not knowing what to do with
him&#383;elf&mdash;married. In his family, to
regain his lo&#383;t con&#383;equence, he determined
to keep up the &#383;ame pa&#383;&#383;ive obedience,
as in the ve&#383;&#383;els in which he had
commanded. His orders were not to be
di&#383;puted; and the whole hou&#383;e was expected
to fly, at the word of command,
as if to man the &#383;hrouds, or mount aloft
in an elemental &#383;trife, big with life or
death. He was to be in&#383;tantaneou&#383;ly
obeyed, e&#383;pecially by my mother, whom
he very benevolently married for love;
but took care to remind her of the obligation,
when &#383;he dared, in the &#383;lighte&#383;t
in&#383;tance, to que&#383;tion his ab&#383;olute authority.
My elde&#383;t brother, it is true, as
he grew up, was treated with more re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-143_S" id="Pg_1-143_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-143.png">143</a>]</span>&#383;pect
by my father; and became in due
form the deputy-tyrant of the hou&#383;e.
The repre&#383;entative of my father, a being
privileged by nature&mdash;a boy, and
the darling of my mother, he did not
fail to act like an heir apparent. Such
indeed was my mother's extravagant
partiality, that, in compari&#383;on with her
affection for him, &#383;he might be &#383;aid not
to love the re&#383;t of her children. Yet
none of the children &#383;eemed to have &#383;o
little affection for her. Extreme indulgence
had rendered him &#383;o &#383;elfi&#383;h,
that he only thought of him&#383;elf; and
from tormenting in&#383;ects and animals, he
became the de&#383;pot of his brothers, and
&#383;till more of his &#383;i&#383;ters.</p>

<p>"It is perhaps difficult to give you an
idea of the petty cares which ob&#383;cured
the morning of my life; continual re&#383;traint

as a mere child, I &#383;oon di&#383;covered to be
unrea&#383;onable, becau&#383;e incon&#383;i&#383;tent and
contradictory. Thus are we de&#383;tined

<p>"The circum&#383;tances which, during
my childhood, occurred to fa&#383;hion my

revive the fading remembrance of new-born
delight, than you, my child, could
feel in the peru&#383;al, I will not entice
you to &#383;tray with me into the verdant
meadow, to &#383;earch for the flowers that
youthful hopes &#383;catter in every path;

<p>"I had two &#383;i&#383;ters, and one brother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-145_S" id="Pg_1-145_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-145.png">145</a>]</span>
younger than my&#383;elf; my brother Robert
was two years older, and might
truly be termed the idol of his parents,
and the torment of the re&#383;t of the family.
Such indeed is the force of prejudice,
that what was called &#383;pirit and
wit in him, was cruelly repre&#383;&#383;ed as
forwardne&#383;s in me.</p>

<p>"My mother had an indolence of
character, which prevented her from
paying much attention to our education.
But the healthy breeze of a
neighbouring heath, on which we
bounded at plea&#383;ure, volatilized the
humours that improper food might
have generated. And to enjoy open
air and freedom, was paradi&#383;e, after
the unnatural re&#383;traint of our fire-&#383;ide,
where we were often obliged to &#383;it
three or four hours together, without
daring to utter a word, when my fa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-146_S" id="Pg_1-146_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-146.png">146</a>]</span>ther
was out of humour, from want of
employment, or of a variety of boi&#383;terous
amu&#383;ement. I had however one
advantage, an in&#383;tructor, the brother
of my father, who, intended for the
church, had of cour&#383;e received a
liberal education. But, becoming attached
to a young lady of great beauty
and large fortune, and acquiring in the
world &#383;ome opinions not con&#383;onant
with the profe&#383;&#383;ion for which he was
de&#383;igned, he accepted, with the mo&#383;t
&#383;anguine expectations of &#383;ucce&#383;s, the
offer of a nobleman to accompany him
to India, as his confidential &#383;ecretary.</p>

<p>"A corre&#383;pondence was regularly
kept up with the object of his affection;
and the intricacies of bu&#383;ine&#383;s, peculiarly
weari&#383;ome to a man of a romantic
turn of mind, contributed, with a forced
ab&#383;ence, to increa&#383;e his attachment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-147_S" id="Pg_1-147_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-147.png">147</a>]</span>
Every other pa&#383;&#383;ion was lo&#383;t in this
ma&#383;ter-one, and only &#383;erved to &#383;well the
torrent. Her relations, &#383;uch were his
waking dreams, who had de&#383;pi&#383;ed him,
would court in their turn his alliance,
and all the blandi&#383;hments of ta&#383;te would
grace the triumph of love.&mdash;While he
ba&#383;ked in the warm &#383;un&#383;hine of love,
friend&#383;hip al&#383;o promi&#383;ed to &#383;hed its
dewy fre&#383;hne&#383;s; for a friend, whom he
loved next to his mi&#383;tre&#383;s, was the confident,
who forwarded the letters from
one to the other, to elude the ob&#383;ervation
of prying relations. A friend fal&#383;e
in &#383;imilar circum&#383;tances, is, my deare&#383;t
girl, an old tale; yet, let not this example,
or the frigid caution of cold-blooded
morali&#383;ts, make you endeavour
to &#383;tifle hopes, which are the buds that
naturally unfold them&#383;elves during the
&#383;pring of life! Whil&#383;t your own heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-148_S" id="Pg_1-148_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-148.png">148</a>]</span>
is &#383;incere, always expect to meet one
glowing with the &#383;ame &#383;entiments; for
to fly from plea&#383;ure, is not to avoid
pain!</p>

<p>"My uncle realized, by good luck,
rather than management, a hand&#383;ome
fortune; and returning on the wings of
love, lo&#383;t in the mo&#383;t enchanting reveries,
to England, to &#383;hare it with his
mi&#383;tre&#383;s and his friend, he found them&mdash;united.</p>

<p>"There were &#383;ome circum&#383;tances, not
nece&#383;&#383;ary for me to recite, which aggravated
the guilt of the friend beyond mea&#383;ure,
and the deception, that had been carried
on to the la&#383;t moment, was &#383;o ba&#383;e,
it produced the mo&#383;t violent effect on
my uncle's health and &#383;pirits. His native
country, the world! lately a garden of
blooming &#383;weets, bla&#383;ted by treachery,
&#383;eemed changed into a parched de&#383;ert,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-149_S" id="Pg_1-149_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-149.png">149</a>]</span>
the abode of hi&#383;&#383;ing &#383;erpents. Di&#383;appointment
rankled in his heart; and,
brooding over his wrongs, he was attacked
by a raging fever, followed by
a derangement of mind, which only
gave place to habitual melancholy, as
he recovered more &#383;trength of body.</p>

<p>"Declaring an intention never to
marry, his relations were ever clu&#383;tering
about him, paying the gro&#383;&#383;e&#383;t adulation
to a man, who, di&#383;gu&#383;ted with
mankind, received them with &#383;corn, or
bitter &#383;arca&#383;ms. Something in my
countenance plea&#383;ed him, when I began
to prattle. Since his return, he appeared
dead to affection; but I &#383;oon,
by &#383;howing him innocent fondne&#383;s, became
a favourite; and endeavouring
to enlarge and &#383;trengthen my mind, I
grew dear to him in proportion as I imbibed
his &#383;entiments. He had a forcible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-150_S" id="Pg_1-150_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-150.png">150</a>]</span>
manner of &#383;peaking, rendered more
&#383;o by a certain impre&#383;&#383;ive wildne&#383;s of
look and ge&#383;ture, calculated to engage
the attention of a young and ardent
mind. It is not then &#383;urpri&#383;ing that I
quickly adopted his opinions in preference,
and reverenced him as one of
a &#383;uperior order of beings. He inculcated,
with great warmth, &#383;elf-re&#383;pect,
and a lofty con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of acting
right, independent of the cen&#383;ure or
applau&#383;e of the world; nay, he almo&#383;t
taught me to brave, and even de&#383;pi&#383;e
its cen&#383;ure, when convinced of the rectitude
of my own intentions.</p>

<p>"Endeavouring to prove to me that
nothing which de&#383;erved the name of
love or friend&#383;hip, exi&#383;ted in the world,
he drew &#383;uch animated pictures of his
own feelings, rendered permanent by
di&#383;appointment, as imprinted the &#383;en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-151_S" id="Pg_1-151_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-151.png">151</a>]</span>timents
&#383;trongly on my heart, and animated
my imagination. The&#383;e remarks
are nece&#383;&#383;ary to elucidate &#383;ome peculiarities
in my character, which by the
world are indefinitely termed romantic.</p>

<p>"My uncle's increa&#383;ing affection led
him to vi&#383;it me often. Still, unable to
re&#383;t in any place, he did not remain
long in the country to &#383;often dome&#383;tic
tyranny; but he brought me books, for
which I had a pa&#383;&#383;ion, and they con&#383;pired
with his conver&#383;ation, to make
me form an ideal picture of life. I &#383;hall
pa&#383;s over the tyranny of my father,
much as I &#383;uffered from it; but it is
nece&#383;&#383;ary to notice, that it undermined
my mother's health; and that
her temper, continually irritated by
dome&#383;tic bickering, became intolerably
peevi&#383;h.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-152_S" id="Pg_1-152_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-152.png">152</a>]</span>
"My elde&#383;t brother was articled to a
neighbouring attorney, the &#383;hrewde&#383;t,
and, I may add, the mo&#383;t unprincipled
man in that part of the country. As
my brother generally came home every
Saturday, to a&#383;toni&#383;h my mother by
exhibiting his attainments, he gradually
a&#383;&#383;umed a right of directing the
whole family, not excepting my father.
He &#383;eemed to take a peculiar plea&#383;ure
in tormenting and humbling me; and
if I ever ventured to complain of this
treatment to either my father or mother,
I was rudely rebuffed for pre&#383;uming
to judge of the conduct of my elde&#383;t
brother.</p>

<p>"About this period a merchant's
family came to &#383;ettle in our neighbourhood.
A man&#383;ion-hou&#383;e in the village,
lately purcha&#383;ed, had been preparing
the whole &#383;pring, and the &#383;ight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-153_S" id="Pg_1-153_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-153.png">153</a>]</span>
co&#383;tly furniture, &#383;ent from London, had
excited my mother's envy, and rou&#383;ed
my father's pride. My &#383;en&#383;ations were
very different, and all of a plea&#383;urable
kind. I longed to &#383;ee new characters,
to break the tedious monotony of my
life; and to find a friend, &#383;uch as fancy
had pourtrayed. I cannot then de&#383;cribe
the emotion I felt, the Sunday they
made their appearance at church. My
eyes were rivetted on the pillar round
which I expected fir&#383;t to catch a glimp&#383;e
of them, and darted forth to meet a
&#383;ervant who ha&#383;tily preceded a group
of ladies, who&#383;e white robes and waving
plumes, &#383;eemed to &#383;tream along the
gloomy ai&#383;le, diffu&#383;ing the light, by
which I contemplated their figures.</p>

<p>"We vi&#383;ited them in form; and I
quickly &#383;elected the elde&#383;t daughter for
my friend. The &#383;econd &#383;on, George,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-154_S" id="Pg_1-154_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-154.png">154</a>]</span>
paid me particular attention, and finding
his attainments and manners &#383;uperior
to tho&#383;e of the young men of the
village, I began to imagine him &#383;uperior
to the re&#383;t of mankind. Had my home
been more comfortable, or my previous
acquaintance more numerous, I &#383;hould
not probably have been &#383;o eager to
open my heart to new affections.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables, the merchant, had
acquired a large fortune by unremitting
attention to bu&#383;ine&#383;s; but his health declining
rapidly, he was obliged to retire,
before his &#383;on, George, had acquired
&#383;ufficient experience, to enable
him to conduct their affairs on the &#383;ame
prudential plan, his father had invariably
pur&#383;ued. Indeed, he had laboured
to throw off his authority,
having de&#383;pi&#383;ed his narrow plans and
cautious &#383;peculation. The elde&#383;t &#383;on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-155_S" id="Pg_1-155_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-155.png">155</a>]</span>
could not be prevailed on to enter the
firm; and, to oblige his wife, and have
peace in the hou&#383;e, Mr. Venables had
purcha&#383;ed a commi&#383;&#383;ion for him in the
guards.</p>

<p>"I am now alluding to circum&#383;tances
which came to my knowledge long
after; but it is nece&#383;&#383;ary, my deare&#383;t
child, that you &#383;hould know the character
of your father, to prevent your
de&#383;pi&#383;ing your mother; the only parent
inclined to di&#383;charge a parent's duty.
In London, George had acquired habits
of libertini&#383;m, which he carefully concealed
from his father and his commercial
connections. The ma&#383;k he
wore, was &#383;o complete a covering of
his real vi&#383;age, that the prai&#383;e his father
lavi&#383;hed on his conduct, and, poor
mi&#383;taken man! on his principles, contra&#383;ted
with his brother's, rendered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-156_S" id="Pg_1-156_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-156.png">156</a>]</span>
notice he took of me peculiarly flattering.
Without any fixed de&#383;ign, as I
am now convinced, he continued to
&#383;ingle me out at the dance, pre&#383;s my
hand at parting, and utter expre&#383;&#383;ions
of unmeaning pa&#383;&#383;ion, to which I gave
a meaning naturally &#383;ugge&#383;ted by the
romantic turn of my thoughts. His
&#383;tay in the country was &#383;hort; his manners
did not entirely plea&#383;e me; but,
when he left us, the colouring of my
picture became more vivid&mdash;Whither
did not my imagination lead me? In
&#383;hort, I fancied my&#383;elf in love&mdash;in love
with the di&#383;intere&#383;tedne&#383;s, fortitude,
genero&#383;ity, dignity, and humanity, with
which I had inve&#383;ted the hero I dubbed.
A circum&#383;tance which &#383;oon after
occurred, rendered all the&#383;e virtues
palpable. [The incident is perhaps
worth relating on other accounts, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-157_S" id="Pg_1-157_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-157.png">157</a>]</span>
therefore I &#383;hall de&#383;cribe it di&#383;tinctly.]</p>

<p>"I had a great affection for my nur&#383;e,
old Mary, for whom I u&#383;ed often to
work, to &#383;pare her eyes. Mary had a
younger &#383;i&#383;ter, married to a &#383;ailor, while
&#383;he was &#383;uckling me; for my mother
only &#383;uckled my elde&#383;t brother, which
might be the cau&#383;e of her extraordinary
partiality. Peggy, Mary's &#383;i&#383;ter, lived
with her, till her hu&#383;band, becoming a
mate in a We&#383;t-India trader, got a little
before-hand in the world. He
wrote to his wife from the fir&#383;t port in
the Channel, after his mo&#383;t &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful
voyage, to reque&#383;t her to come to
London to meet him; he even wi&#383;hed
her to determine on living there for the
future, to &#383;ave him the trouble of coming
to her the moment he came on
&#383;hore; and to turn a penny by keeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-158_S" id="Pg_1-158_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-158.png">158</a>]</span>
a green-&#383;tall. It was too much to &#383;et out
on a journey the moment he had fini&#383;hed
a voyage, and fifty miles by land, was
wor&#383;e than a thou&#383;and leagues by &#383;ea.</p>

<p>"She packed up her alls, and came to
London&mdash;but did not meet hone&#383;t Daniel.
A common mi&#383;fortune prevented
her, and the poor are bound to &#383;uffer
for the good of their country&mdash;he was
pre&#383;&#383;ed in the river&mdash;and never came on
&#383;hore.</p>

<p>"Peggy was mi&#383;erable in London,
not knowing, as &#383;he &#383;aid, 'the face of
any living &#383;oul.' Be&#383;ides, her imagination
had been employed, anticipating
a month or &#383;ix weeks' happine&#383;s with
her hu&#383;band. Daniel was to have gone
with her to Sadler's Wells, and We&#383;tmin&#383;ter
Abbey, and to many &#383;ights,
which he knew &#383;he never heard of in
the country. Peggy too was thrifty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-159_S" id="Pg_1-159_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-159.png">159</a>]</span>
and how could &#383;he manage to put his
plan in execution alone? He had acquaintance;
but &#383;he did not know the
very name of their places of abode.
His letters were made up of&mdash;How do
you does, and God ble&#383;s yous,&mdash;information
was re&#383;erved for the hour of
meeting.</p>

<p>"She too had her portion of information,
near at heart. Molly and Jacky
were grown &#383;uch little darlings, &#383;he
was almo&#383;t angry that daddy did not
&#383;ee their tricks. She had not half the
plea&#383;ure &#383;he &#383;hould have had from their
prattle, could &#383;he have recounted to
him each night the pretty &#383;peeches of
the day. Some &#383;tories, however, were
&#383;tored up&mdash;and Jacky could &#383;ay papa
with &#383;uch a &#383;weet voice, it mu&#383;t delight
his heart. Yet when &#383;he came, and
found no Daniel to greet her, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-160_S" id="Pg_1-160_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-160.png">160</a>]</span>
Jacky called papa, &#383;he wept, bidding
'God ble&#383;s his innocent &#383;oul, that
did not know what &#383;orrow was.'&mdash;But
more &#383;orrow was in &#383;tore for Peggy,
innocent as &#383;he was.&mdash;Daniel was killed
in the fir&#383;t engagement, and then
the <i>papa</i> was agony, &#383;ounding to the
heart.</p>

<p>"She had lived &#383;paringly on his wages,
while there was any hope of his return;
but, that gone, &#383;he returned with a
breaking heart to the country, to a
little market town, nearly three miles
from our village. She did not like to
go to &#383;ervice, to be &#383;nubbed about,
after being her own mi&#383;tre&#383;s. To put
her children out to nur&#383;e was impo&#383;&#383;ible:
how far would her wages go? and
to &#383;end them to her hu&#383;band's pari&#383;h, a
di&#383;tant one, was to lo&#383;e her hu&#383;band
twice over.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-161_S" id="Pg_1-161_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-161.png">161</a>]</span>
"I had heard all from Mary, and
made my uncle furni&#383;h a little cottage
for her, to enable her to &#383;ell&mdash;&#383;o &#383;acred
was poor Daniel's advice, now he was
dead and gone&mdash;a little fruit, toys and
cakes. The minding of the &#383;hop did
not require her whole time, nor even
the keeping her children clean, and
&#383;he loved to &#383;ee them clean; &#383;o &#383;he took
in wa&#383;hing, and altogether made a &#383;hift
to earn bread for her children, &#383;till
weeping for Daniel, when Jacky's arch
looks made her think of his father.&mdash;It
was plea&#383;ant to work for her children.&mdash;'Yes;
from morning till night,
could &#383;he have had a ki&#383;s from their
father, God re&#383;t his &#383;oul! Yes; had
it <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'pla&#383;ed'">plea&#383;ed</ins> Providence to have let him
come back without a leg or an arm, it
would have been the &#383;ame thing to her&mdash;for
&#383;he did not love him becau&#383;e he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-162_S" id="Pg_1-162_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-162.png">162</a>]</span>
maintained them&mdash;no; &#383;he had hands
of her own.'</p>

<p>"The country people were hone&#383;t,
and Peggy left her linen out to dry
very late. A recruiting party, as &#383;he
&#383;uppo&#383;ed, pa&#383;&#383;ing through, made free
with a large wa&#383;h; for it was all &#383;wept
away, including her own and her children's
little &#383;tock.</p>

<p>"This was a dreadful blow; two dozen
of &#383;hirts, &#383;tocks and handkerchiefs.
She gave the money which &#383;he
had laid by for half a year's rent, and
promi&#383;ed to pay two &#383;hillings a week
till all was cleared; &#383;o &#383;he did not lo&#383;e
her employment. This two &#383;hillings a
week, and the buying a few nece&#383;&#383;aries
for the children, drove her &#383;o hard,
that &#383;he had not a penny to pay her rent
with, when a twelvemonth's became
due.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-163_S" id="Pg_1-163_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-163.png">163</a>]</span>
"She was now with Mary, and had
ju&#383;t told her tale, which Mary in&#383;tantly
repeated&mdash;it was intended for my
ear. Many hou&#383;es in this town, producing
a borough-intere&#383;t, were included
in the e&#383;tate purcha&#383;ed by Mr.
Venables, and the attorney with whom
my brother lived, was appointed his
agent, to collect and rai&#383;e the rents.</p>

<p>"He demanded Peggy's, and, in
&#383;pite of her intreaties, her poor goods

came down; and then I would tell him
all the whole truth, and if he ab&#383;olved
me, heaven would.</p>

<p>"I begged the hou&#383;e-maid to come
up &#383;tairs with me (&#383;ervants always feel
for the di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es of poverty, and &#383;o
would the rich if they knew what it
was). She a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted me to tie up the
mattra&#383;s; I di&#383;covering, at the &#383;ame
time, that one blanket would &#383;erve me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-165_S" id="Pg_1-165_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-165.png">165</a>]</span>
till winter, could I per&#383;uade my &#383;i&#383;ter,
who &#383;lept with me, to keep my &#383;ecret.
She entering in the mid&#383;t of the package,
I gave her &#383;ome new feathers, to
&#383;ilence her. We got the mattra&#383;s
down the back &#383;tairs, unperceived,
and I helped to carry it, taking with
me all the money I had, and what I
could borrow from my &#383;i&#383;ter.</p>

<p>"When I got to the cottage, Peggy
declared that &#383;he would not take what
I had brought &#383;ecretly; but, when,
with all the eager eloquence in&#383;pired
by a decided purpo&#383;e, I gra&#383;ped her
hand with weeping eyes, a&#383;&#383;uring her
that my uncle would &#383;creen me from
blame, when he was once more in the
country, de&#383;cribing, at the &#383;ame time,
what &#383;he would &#383;uffer in parting with
her children, after keeping them &#383;o
long from being thrown on the pari&#383;h,
&#383;he reluctantly con&#383;ented.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-166_S" id="Pg_1-166_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-166.png">166</a>]</span>
"My project of u&#383;efulne&#383;s ended not
here; I determined to &#383;peak to the
attorney; he frequently paid me compliments.
His character did not intimidate
me; but, imagining that Peggy
mu&#383;t be mi&#383;taken, and that no man
could turn a deaf ear to &#383;uch a tale of
complicated di&#383;tre&#383;s, I determined to
walk to the town with Mary the next
morning, and reque&#383;t him to wait for
the rent, and keep my &#383;ecret, till my
uncle's return.</p>

<p>"My repo&#383;e was &#383;weet; and, waking
with the fir&#383;t dawn of day, I bounded
to Mary's cottage. What charms do
not a light heart &#383;pread over nature!
Every bird that twittered in a bu&#383;h,
every flower that enlivened the hedge,
&#383;eemed placed there to awaken me to
rapture&mdash;yes; to rapture. The pre&#383;ent
moment was full fraught with happi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-167_S" id="Pg_1-167_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-167.png">167</a>]</span>ne&#383;s;
and on futurity I be&#383;towed not a
thought, excepting to anticipate my
&#383;ucce&#383;s with the attorney.</p>

<p>"This man of the world, with ro&#383;y
face and &#383;impering features, received
me politely, nay kindly; li&#383;tened with
complacency to my remon&#383;trances,
though he &#383;carcely heeded Mary's tears.
I did not then &#383;u&#383;pect, that my eloquence
was in my complexion, the
blu&#383;h of &#383;eventeen, or that, in a world
where humanity to women is the characteri&#383;tic
of advancing civilization, the
beauty of a young girl was &#383;o much
more intere&#383;ting than the di&#383;tre&#383;s of an
old one. Pre&#383;&#383;ing my hand, he promi&#383;ed
to let Peggy remain in the hou&#383;e
as long as I wi&#383;hed.&mdash;I more than returned
the pre&#383;&#383;ure&mdash;I was &#383;o grateful
and &#383;o happy. Emboldened by my innocent
warmth, he then ki&#383;&#383;ed me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-168_S" id="Pg_1-168_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-168.png">168</a>]</span>&mdash;and
I did not draw back&mdash;I took it for
a ki&#383;s of charity.</p>

<p>"Gay as a lark, I went to dine at Mr.
Venables'. I had previou&#383;ly obtained
five &#383;hillings from my father, towards
re-clothing the poor children of my
care, and prevailed on my mother to
take one of the girls into the hou&#383;e, whom
I determined to teach to work and read.</p>

<p>"After dinner, when the younger part
of the circle retired to the mu&#383;ic room,
I recounted with energy my tale; that
is, I mentioned Peggy's di&#383;tre&#383;s, without
hinting at the &#383;teps I had taken to
relieve her. Mi&#383;s Venables gave me
half-a-crown; the heir five &#383;hillings;
but George &#383;at unmoved. I was cruelly
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed by the di&#383;appointment&mdash;I
&#383;carcely could remain on my chair;
and, could I have got out of the room
unperceived, I &#383;hould have flown home,
as if to run away from my&#383;elf. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-169_S" id="Pg_1-169_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-169.png">169</a>]</span>
&#383;everal vain attempts to ri&#383;e, I leaned
my head again&#383;t the marble chimney-piece,
and gazing on the evergreens
that filled the fire-place, moralized on
the vanity of human expectations; regardle&#383;s
of the company. I was rou&#383;ed
by a gentle tap on my &#383;houlder from
behind Charlotte's chair. I turned
my head, and George &#383;lid a guinea into
my hand, putting his finger to his
mouth, to enjoin me &#383;ilence.</p>

<p>"What a revolution took place, not
only in my train of thoughts, but feelings!
I trembled with emotion&mdash;now,
indeed, I was in love. Such delicacy
too, to enhance his benevolence! I felt
in my pocket every five minutes, only
to feel the guinea; and its magic touch
inve&#383;ted my hero with more than mortal
beauty. My fancy had found a ba&#383;is
to erect its model of perfection on;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-170_S" id="Pg_1-170_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-170.png">170</a>]</span>
and quickly went to work, with all the
happy credulity of youth, to con&#383;ider
that heart as devoted to virtue, which
had only obeyed a virtuous impul&#383;e.
The bitter experience was yet to come,
that has taught me how very di&#383;tinct
are the principles of virtue, from the
ca&#383;ual feelings from which they germinate.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_VIII_S" id="CHAP_VIII_S"></a>CHAP. VIII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I have</span> perhaps dwelt too long on
a circum&#383;tance, which is only of importance
as it marks the progre&#383;s of a
deception that has been &#383;o fatal to my
peace; and introduces to your notice a
poor girl, whom, intending to &#383;erve, I led
to ruin. Still it is probable that I was
not entirely the victim of mi&#383;take; and
that your father, gradually fa&#383;hioned
by the world, did not quickly become
what I he&#383;itate to call him&mdash;out of
re&#383;pect to my daughter.</p>

<p>"But, to ha&#383;ten to the more bu&#383;y
&#383;cenes of my life. Mr. Venables and
my mother died the &#383;ame &#383;ummer;
and, wholly engro&#383;&#383;ed by my attention
to her, I thought of little el&#383;e.
The neglect of her darling, my brother
Robert, had a violent effect on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-172_S" id="Pg_1-172_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-172.png">172</a>]</span>
her weakened mind; for, though boys
may be reckoned the pillars of the
hou&#383;e without doors, girls are often the
only comfort within. They but too frequently
wa&#383;te their health and &#383;pirits
attending a dying parent, who leaves
them in comparative poverty. After
clo&#383;ing, with filial piety, a father's
eyes, they are cha&#383;ed from the paternal
roof, to make room for the fir&#383;t-born,
the &#383;on, who is to carry the
empty family-name down to po&#383;terity;
though, occupied with his own plea&#383;ures,
he &#383;carcely thought of di&#383;charging,
in the decline of his parent's life,
the debt contracted in his childhood.
My mother's conduct led me to make
the&#383;e reflections. Great as was the fatigue
I endured, and the affection my
uncea&#383;ing &#383;olicitude evinced, of which
my mother &#383;eemed perfectly &#383;en&#383;ible,
&#383;till, when my brother, whom I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-173_S" id="Pg_1-173_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-173.png">173</a>]</span>
hardly per&#383;uade to remain a quarter of
an hour in her chamber, was with her
alone, a &#383;hort time before her death,
&#383;he gave him a little hoard, which &#383;he
had been &#383;ome years accumulating.</p>

<p>"During my mother's illne&#383;s, I was
obliged to manage my father's temper,
who, from the lingering nature of her
malady, began to imagine that it was
merely fancy. At this period, an artful
kind of upper &#383;ervant attracted my
father's attention, and the neighbours
made many remarks on the finery, not
hone&#383;tly got, exhibited at evening &#383;ervice.
But I was too much occupied
with my mother to ob&#383;erve any change
in her dre&#383;s or behaviour, or to li&#383;ten to
the whi&#383;per of &#383;candal.</p>

<p>"I &#383;hall not dwell on the death-bed
&#383;cene, lively as is the remembrance,
or on the emotion produced by the la&#383;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-174_S" id="Pg_1-174_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-174.png">174</a>]</span>
gra&#383;p of my mother's cold hand; when
ble&#383;&#383;ing me, &#383;he added, 'A little patience,
and all will be over!' Ah!
my child, how often have tho&#383;e words
rung mournfully in my ears&mdash;and I
have exclaimed&mdash;'A little more patience,
and I too &#383;hall be at re&#383;t!'</p>

<p>"My father was violently affected
by her death, recollected in&#383;tances of
his unkindne&#383;s, and wept like a child.</p>

<p>"My mother had &#383;olemnly recommended
my &#383;i&#383;ters to my care, and bid
me be a mother to them. They, indeed,
became more dear to me as they
became more forlorn; for, during my
mother's illne&#383;s, I di&#383;covered the ruined
&#383;tate of my father's circum&#383;tances,
and that he had only been able to keep
up appearances, by the &#383;ums which he
borrowed of my uncle.</p>

<p>"My father's grief, and con&#383;equent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-175_S" id="Pg_1-175_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-175.png">175</a>]</span>
tenderne&#383;s to his children, quickly
abated, the hou&#383;e grew &#383;till more
gloomy or riotous; and my refuge
from care was again at Mr. Venables';
the young '&#383;quire having taken his father's
place, and allowing, for the pre&#383;ent,
his &#383;i&#383;ter to pre&#383;ide at his table.
George, though di&#383;&#383;ati&#383;fied with his
portion of the fortune, which had till
lately been all in trade, vi&#383;ited the family
as u&#383;ual. He was now full of &#383;peculations
in trade, and his brow became
clouded by care. He &#383;eemed to relax
in his attention to me, when the pre&#383;ence
of my uncle gave a new turn to
his behaviour. I was too un&#383;u&#383;pecting,
too di&#383;intere&#383;ted, to trace the&#383;e changes
to their &#383;ource.</p>

<p>My home every day became more
and more di&#383;agreeable to me; my liberty
was unnece&#383;&#383;arily abridged, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-176_S" id="Pg_1-176_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-176.png">176</a>]</span>
my books, on the pretext that they made
me idle, taken from me. My father's
mi&#383;tre&#383;s was with child, and he, doating
on her, allowed or overlooked her
vulgar manner of tyrannizing over us.
I was indignant, e&#383;pecially when I &#383;aw
her endeavouring to attract, &#383;hall I
&#383;ay &#383;educe? my younger brother. By
allowing women but one way of ri&#383;ing
in the world, the fo&#383;tering the libertini&#383;m
of men, &#383;ociety makes mon&#383;ters
of them, and then their ignoble
vices are brought forward as a proof of
inferiority of intellect.</p>

<p>The weari&#383;omene&#383;s of my &#383;ituation
can &#383;carcely be de&#383;cribed. Though my
life had not pa&#383;&#383;ed in the mo&#383;t even tenour
with my mother, it was paradi&#383;e
to that I was de&#383;tined to endure with
my father's mi&#383;tre&#383;s, jealous of her illegitimate
authority. My father's former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-177_S" id="Pg_1-177_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-177.png">177</a>]</span>
occa&#383;ional tenderne&#383;s, in &#383;pite of his
violence of temper, had been &#383;oothing
to me; but now he only met me with
reproofs or portentous frowns. The
hou&#383;e-keeper, as &#383;he was now termed,
was the vulgar de&#383;pot of the family;
and a&#383;&#383;uming the new character of a
fine lady, &#383;he could never forgive the
contempt which was &#383;ometimes vi&#383;ible
in my countenance, when &#383;he uttered
with pompo&#383;ity her bad Engli&#383;h, or
affected to be well bred.</p>

<p>To my uncle I ventured to open my
heart; and he, with his wonted benevolence,
began to con&#383;ider in what
manner he could extricate me out of
my pre&#383;ent irk&#383;ome &#383;ituation. In &#383;pite
of his own di&#383;appointment, or, mo&#383;t
probably, actuated by the feelings that
had been petrified, not cooled, in all
their &#383;anguine fervour, like a boiling
torrent of lava &#383;uddenly da&#383;hing into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-178_S" id="Pg_1-178_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-178.png">178</a>]</span>
the &#383;ea, he thought a marriage of mutual
inclination (would envious &#383;tars
permit it) the only chance for happine&#383;s
in this di&#383;a&#383;trous world. George
Venables had the reputation of being
attentive to bu&#383;ine&#383;s, and my father's
example gave great weight to this circum&#383;tance;
for habits of order in bu&#383;ine&#383;s
would, he conceived, extend to
the regulation of the affections in dome&#383;tic
life. George &#383;eldom &#383;poke in
my uncle's company, except to utter a
&#383;hort, judicious que&#383;tion, or to make a
pertinent remark, with all due deference
to his &#383;uperior judgment; &#383;o that
my uncle &#383;eldom left his company without
ob&#383;erving, that the young man had
more in him than people &#383;uppo&#383;ed.</p>

<p>In this opinion he was not &#383;ingular;
yet, believe me, and I am not &#383;wayed
by re&#383;entment, the&#383;e &#383;peeches &#383;o ju&#383;tly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-179_S" id="Pg_1-179_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-179.png">179</a>]</span>
poized, this &#383;ilent deference, when the
animal &#383;pirits of other young people
were throwing off youthful ebullitions,
were not the effect of thought or humility,
but &#383;heer barrenne&#383;s of mind,
and want of imagination. A colt of
mettle will curvet and &#383;hew his paces.
Yes; my dear girl, the&#383;e prudent
young men want all the fire nece&#383;&#383;ary
to ferment their faculties, and are characterized
as wi&#383;e, only becau&#383;e they
are not fooli&#383;h. It is true, that George
was by no means &#383;o great a favourite
of mine as during the fir&#383;t year of our
acquaintance; &#383;till, as he often coincided
in opinion with me, and echoed
my &#383;entiments; and having my&#383;elf no
other attachment, I heard with plea&#383;ure
my uncle's propo&#383;al; but thought
more of obtaining my freedom, than
of my lover. But, when George, &#383;eem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-180_S" id="Pg_1-180_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-180.png">180</a>]</span>ingly
anxious for my happine&#383;s, pre&#383;&#383;ed
me to quit my pre&#383;ent painful &#383;ituation,
my heart &#383;welled with gratitude&mdash;I
knew not that my uncle had promi&#383;ed
him five thou&#383;and pounds.</p>

<p>Had this truly generous man mentioned
his intention to me, I &#383;hould have in&#383;i&#383;ted
on a thou&#383;and pounds being &#383;ettled
on each of my &#383;i&#383;ters; George would
have conte&#383;ted; I &#383;hould have &#383;een his
&#383;elfi&#383;h &#383;oul; and&mdash;gracious God! have
been &#383;pared the mi&#383;ery of di&#383;covering,
when too late, that I was united to a
heartle&#383;s, unprincipled wretch. All
my &#383;chemes of u&#383;efulne&#383;s would not
then have been bla&#383;ted. The tenderne&#383;s
of my heart would not have heated
my imagination with vi&#383;ions of the
ineffable delight of happy love; nor
would the &#383;weet duty of a mother have
been &#383;o cruelly interrupted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-181_S" id="Pg_1-181_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v1-181.png">181</a>]</span>
But I mu&#383;t not &#383;uffer the fortitude
I have &#383;o hardly acquired, to be undermined
by unavailing regret. Let me
ha&#383;ten forward to de&#383;cribe the turbid
&#383;tream in which I had to wade&mdash;but
let me exultingly declare that it is
pa&#383;&#383;ed&mdash;my &#383;oul holds fellow&#383;hip with
him no more. He cut the Gordian
knot, which my principles, mi&#383;taken
ones, re&#383;pected; he di&#383;&#383;olved the tie, the
fetters rather, that ate into my very
vitals&mdash;and I &#383;hould rejoice, con&#383;cious
that my mind is freed, though confined
in hell it&#383;elf; the only place that even
fancy can imagine more dreadful than
my pre&#383;ent abode.</p>

<p>The&#383;e varying emotions will not allow
me to proceed. I heave &#383;igh after
&#383;igh; yet my heart is &#383;till oppre&#383;&#383;ed.
For what am I re&#383;erved? Why was I not
born a man, or why was I born at all?</p>
