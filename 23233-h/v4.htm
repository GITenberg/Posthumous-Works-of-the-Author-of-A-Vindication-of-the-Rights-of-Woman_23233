<h4>LETTER LXVII</h4>

<p class="right">September 27.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you receive this, I shall either
have landed, or be hovering on
the British coast&mdash;your letter of the 18th
decided me.</p>

<p>By what criterion of principle or affection,
you term my questions extraordinary
and unnecessary, I cannot determine.&mdash;You
desire me to decide&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-2" id="Pg_4-2"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-2.png">2</a>]</span>
had decided. You must have had long
ago two letters of mine, from &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
to the same purport, to consider.&mdash;In
these, God knows! there was but too
much affection, and the agonies of a
distracted mind were but too faithfully
pourtrayed!&mdash;What more then had
I to say?&mdash;The negative was to come
from you.&mdash;You had perpetually recurred
to your promise of meeting me
in the autumn&mdash;Was it extraordinary
that I should demand a yes, or no?&mdash;Your
letter is written with extreme
harshness, coldness I am accustomed
to, in it I find not a trace of the tenderness
of humanity, much less of friendship.&mdash;I
only see a desire to heave a
load off your shoulders.</p>

<p>I am above disputing about words.&mdash;It
matters not in what terms you decide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-3" id="Pg_4-3"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-3.png">3</a>]</span>
The tremendous power who formed
this heart, must have foreseen that, in
a world in which self-interest, in various
shapes, is the principal mobile, I
had little chance of escaping misery.&mdash;To
the fiat of fate I submit.&mdash;I am content
to be wretched; but I will not be
contemptible.&mdash;Of me you have no
cause to complain, but for having had
too much regard for you&mdash;for having
expected a degree of permanent happiness,
when you only sought for a
momentary gratification.</p>

<p>I am strangely deficient in sagacity.&mdash;Uniting
myself to you, your tenderness
seemed to make me amends for all my
former misfortunes.&mdash;On this tenderness
and affection with what confidence
did I rest!&mdash;but I leaned on a spear, that
has pierced me to the heart.&mdash;You
have thrown off a faithful friend, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-4" id="Pg_4-4"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-4.png">4</a>]</span>
pursue the caprices of the moment.&mdash;We
certainly are differently organized;
for even now, when conviction has
been stamped on my soul by sorrow, I
can scarcely believe it possible. It depends
at present on you, whether you
will see me or not.&mdash;I shall take no
step, till I see or hear from you.</p>

<p>Preparing myself for the worst&mdash;I
have determined, if your next letter be
like the last, to write to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
to procure me an obscure lodging, and
not to inform any body of my arrival.&mdash;There
I will endeavour in a few months
to obtain the sum necessary to take me
to France&mdash;from you I will not receive
any more.&mdash;I am not yet sufficiently
humbled to depend on your beneficence.</p>

<p>Some people, whom my unhappiness
has interested, though they know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-5" id="Pg_4-5"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-5.png">5</a>]</span>
not the extent of it, will assist me to
attain the object I have in view, the
independence of my child. Should a
peace take place, ready money will go
a great way in France&mdash;and I will borrow
a sum, which my industry <i>shall</i>
enable me to pay at my leisure, to purchase
a small estate for my girl.&mdash;The
assistance I shall find necessary to complete
her education, I can get at an
easy rate at Paris&mdash;I can introduce her
to such society as she will like&mdash;and
thus, securing for her all the chance
for happiness, which depends on me, I
shall die in peace, persuaded that the
felicity which has hitherto cheated
my expectation, will not always elude
my grasp. No poor tempest-tossed
mariner ever more earnestly longed to
arrive at his port.</p>

<p class="right">* * * *</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-6" id="Pg_4-6"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-6.png">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>I shall not come up in the vessel all
the way, because I have no place to go
to. Captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; will inform you
where I am. It is needless to add, that
I am not in a state of mind to bear suspense&mdash;and
that I wish to see you,
though it be for the last time.</p>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER LXVIII</h4>

<p class="right">Sunday, October 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I wrote</span> to you by the packet, to
inform you, that your letter of the 18th
of last month, had determined me to
set out with captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; but, as
we sailed very quick, I take it for
granted, that you have not yet received
it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-7" id="Pg_4-7"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-7.png">7</a>]</span>
You say, I must decide for myself.&mdash;I
had decided, that it was most for the
interest of my little girl, and for my
own comfort, little as I expect, for us
to live together; and I even thought
that you would be glad, some years
hence, when the tumult of business was
over, to repose in the society of an affectionate
friend, and mark the progress
of our interesting child, whilst endeavouring
to be of use in the circle you
at last resolved to rest in; for you cannot
run about for ever.</p>

<p>From the tenour of your last letter
however, I am led to imagine, that you
have formed some new attachment.&mdash;If
it be so, let me earnestly request you
to see me once more, and immediately.
This is the only proof I require of the
friendship you profess for me. I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-8" id="Pg_4-8"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-8.png">8</a>]</span>
then decide, since you boggle about a
mere form.</p>

<p>I am labouring to write with calmness&mdash;but
the extreme anguish I feel,
at landing without having any friend
to receive me, and even to be conscious
that the friend whom I most wish
to see, will feel a disagreeable sensation
at being informed of my arrival, does
not come under the description of common
misery. Every emotion yields to
an overwhelming flood of sorrow&mdash;and
the playfulness of my child distresses
me.&mdash;On her account, I wished
to remain a few days here, comfortless
as is my situation.&mdash;Besides, I did not
wish to surprise you. You have told
me, that you would make any sacrifice
to promote my happiness&mdash;and, even in
your last unkind letter, you talk of the
ties which bind you to me and my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-9" id="Pg_4-9"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-9.png">9</a>]</span>
child.&mdash;Tell me, that you wish it, and
I will cut this Gordian knot.</p>

<p>I now most earnestly intreat you to
write to me, without fail, by the return
of the post. Direct your letter to
be left at the post-office, and tell me
whether you will come to me here, or
where you will meet me. I can receive
your letter on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Do not keep me in suspense.&mdash;I expect
nothing from you, or any human
being: my die is cast!&mdash;I have fortitude
enough to determine to do my
duty; yet I cannot raise my depressed
spirits, or calm my trembling heart.&mdash;That
being who moulded it thus,
knows that I am unable to tear up by
the roots the propensity to affection
which has been the torment of my life&mdash;but
life will have an end!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-10" id="Pg_4-10"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-10.png">10</a>]</span>
Should you come here (a few months
ago I could not have doubted it) you
will find me at &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. If you prefer
meeting me on the road, tell me where.</p>

<p class="right">Yours affectionately &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;</p>

<p class="right">* * * *</p>

<h4>LETTER LXIX</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I write</span> you now on my knees; imploring
you to send my child and the
maid with &mdash;&mdash;, to Paris, to be consigned
to the care of Madame &mdash;&mdash;, rue
&mdash;&mdash;, section de &mdash;&mdash;. Should they be
removed, &mdash;&mdash; can give their direction.</p>

<p>Let the maid have all my clothes,
without distinction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-11" id="Pg_4-11"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-11.png">11</a>]</span>
Pray pay the cook her wages, and do
not mention the confession which I
forced from her&mdash;a little sooner or later
is of no consequence. Nothing but
my extreme stupidity could have rendered
me blind so long. Yet, whilst
you assured me that you had no attachment,
I thought we might still
have lived together.</p>

<p>I shall make no comments on your
conduct; or any appeal to the world.
Let my wrongs sleep with me! Soon,
very soon shall I be at peace. When
you receive this, my burning head will
be cold.</p>

<p>I would encounter a thousand deaths,
rather than a night like the last. Your
treatment has thrown my mind into a
state of chaos; yet I am serene. I go
to find comfort, and my only fear is,
that my poor body will be insulted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-12" id="Pg_4-12"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-12.png">12</a>]</span>
an endeavour to recal my hated existence.
But I shall plunge into the
Thames where there is the least chance
of my being snatched from the death I
seek.</p>

<p>God bless you! May you never know
by experience what you have made me
endure. Should your sensibility ever
awake, remorse will find its way to your
heart; and, in the midst of business and
sensual pleasure, I shall appear before
you, the victim of your deviation from
rectitude.</p>

<h4>LETTER LXX</h4>

<p class="right">Sunday Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> only to lament, that, when
the bitterness of death was past, I was
inhumanly brought back to life and
misery. But a fixed determination is
not to be baffled by disappointment;
nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt,
which was one of the calmest
acts of reason. In this respect, I am
only accountable to myself. Did I
care for what is termed reputation, it
is by other circumstances that I should
be dishonoured.</p>

<p>You say, "that you know not how to
extricate ourselves out of the wretchedness
into which we have been plunged."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-14" id="Pg_4-14"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-14.png">14</a>]</span>
You are extricated long since.&mdash;But I
forbear to comment.&mdash;&mdash;If I am condemned
to live longer, it is a living
death.</p>

<p>It appears to me, that you lay much
more stress on delicacy, than on principle;
for I am unable to discover what
sentiment of delicacy would have been
violated, by your visiting a wretched
friend&mdash;if indeed you have any friendship
for me.&mdash;But since your new attachment
is the only thing sacred in
your eyes, I am silent&mdash;Be happy! My
complaints shall never more damp your
enjoyment&mdash;perhaps I am mistaken in
supposing that even my death could, for
more than a moment.&mdash;This is what
you call magnanimity&mdash;It is happy for
yourself, that you possess this quality in
the highest degree.</p>

<p>Your continually asserting, that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-15" id="Pg_4-15"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-15.png">15</a>]</span>
will do all in your power to contribute
to my comfort (when you only allude
to pecuniary assistance), appears to me
a flagrant breach of delicacy.&mdash;I want
not such vulgar comfort, nor will I
accept it. I never wanted but your
heart&mdash;That gone, you have nothing
more to give. Had I only poverty to
fear, I should not shrink from life.&mdash;Forgive
me then, if I say, that I shall
consider any direct or indirect attempt
to supply my necessities, as an insult
which I have not merited&mdash;and as
rather done out of tenderness for your
own reputation, than for me. Do not
mistake me; I do not think that you
value money (therefore I will not accept
what you do not care for)
though I do much less, because certain
privations are not painful to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-16" id="Pg_4-16"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-16.png">16</a>]</span>
When I am dead, respect for yourself
will make you take care of the child.</p>

<p>I write with difficulty&mdash;probably I
shall never write to you again.&mdash;Adieu!</p>

<p class="right">Saturday Night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been hurt by indirect enquiries,

ask "If I am well or tranquil?"&mdash;They

mortified by your continually offering
me pecuniary assistance&mdash;and, considering
your going to the new house, as an
open avowal that you abandon me, let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-19" id="Pg_4-19"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-19.png">19</a>]</span>
me tell you that I will sooner perish
than receive any thing from you&mdash;and
I say this at the moment when I am
disappointed in my first attempt to obtain
a temporary supply. But this
even pleases me; an accumulation of
disappointments and misfortunes seems
to suit the habit of my mind.&mdash;</p>

<p>Have but a little patience, and I will
remove myself where it will not be
necessary for you to talk&mdash;of course,
not to think of me. But let me see,
written by yourself&mdash;for I will not receive
it through any other medium&mdash;that
the affair is finished.&mdash;It is an insult
to me to suppose, that I can be reconciled,
or recover my spirits; but,
if you hear nothing of me, it will be
the same thing to you.</p>

<h4>LETTER LXXV</h4>

<p class="right">London, November 27.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> letter, without an address,
which you put up with the letters you
returned, did not meet my eyes till
just now.&mdash;I had thrown the letters
aside&mdash;I did not wish to look over a
register of sorrow.</p>

<p>My not having seen it, will account
for my having written to you with
anger&mdash;under the impression your departure,
without even a line left for me,
made on me, even after your late conduct,
which could not lead me to expect
much attention to my sufferings.</p>

<p>In fact, "the decided conduct, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-23" id="Pg_4-23"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-23.png">23</a>]</span>
appeared to me so unfeeling," has almost
overturned my reason; my mind
is injured&mdash;I scarcely know where I
am, or what I do.&mdash;The grief I cannot
conquer (for some cruel recollections
never quit me, banishing almost every
other) I labour to conceal in total
solitude.&mdash;My life therefore is but an
exercise of fortitude, continually on
the stretch&mdash;and hope never gleams in
this tomb, where I am buried alive.</p>

<p>But I meant to reason with you, and
not to complain.&mdash;You tell me, "that I
shall judge more coolly of your mode
of acting, some time hence." But is it
not possible that <i>passion</i> clouds your reason,
as much as it does mine?&mdash;and
ought you not to doubt, whether those
principles are so "exalted," as you
term them, which only lead to your
own gratification? In other words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-24" id="Pg_4-24"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-24.png">24</a>]</span>
whether it be just to have no principle
of action, but that of following your
inclination, trampling on the affection
you have fostered, and the expectations
you have excited?</p>

<p>My affection for you is rooted in my
heart.&mdash;I know you are not what you
now seem&mdash;nor will you always act, or
feel, as you now do, though I may
never be comforted by the change.&mdash;Even
at Paris, my image will haunt
you.&mdash;You will see my pale face&mdash;and
sometimes the tears of anguish will
drop on your heart, which you have
forced from mine.</p>

<p>I cannot write. I thought I could
quickly have refuted all your <i>ingenious</i>
arguments; but my head is confused.&mdash;Right
or wrong, I am miserable!</p>

<p>It seems to me, that my conduct has
always been governed by the strictest
principles of justice and truth.&mdash;Yet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-25" id="Pg_4-25"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-25.png">25</a>]</span>
how wretched have my social feelings,
and delicacy of sentiment rendered me!&mdash;I
have loved with my whole soul,
only to discover that I had no chance
of a return&mdash;and that existence is a
burthen without it.</p>

<p>I do not perfectly understand you.&mdash;If,
by the offer of your friendship, you
still only mean pecuniary support&mdash;I
must again reject it.&mdash;Trifling are the
ills of poverty in the scale of my misfortunes.&mdash;God
bless you!</p>

<p class="right">* * * *</p>

<p>I have been treated ungenerously&mdash;if
I understand what is generosity.&mdash;&mdash;You
seem to me only to have been
anxious to shake me off&mdash;regardless
whether you dashed me to atoms by
the fall.&mdash;In truth I have been rudely
handled. <i>Do you judge coolly</i>, and I trust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-26" id="Pg_4-26"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-26.png">26</a>]</span>
you will not continue to call those capricious
feelings "the most refined,"
which would undermine not only the
most sacred principles, but the affections
which unite mankind.&mdash;&mdash;You
would render mothers unnatural&mdash;and
there would be no such thing as a father!&mdash;If
your theory of morals is the
most "exalted," it is certainly the most
easy.&mdash;It does not require much magnanimity,
to determine to please ourselves
for the moment, let others suffer
what they will!</p>

<p>Excuse me for again tormenting you,
my heart thirsts for justice from you&mdash;and
whilst I recollect that you approved
Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s conduct&mdash;I am convinced
you will not always justify your
own.</p>

<p>Beware of the deceptions of passion!
It will not always banish from your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-27" id="Pg_4-27"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-27.png">27</a>]</span>
mind, that you have acted ignobly&mdash;and
condescended to subterfuge to
gloss over the conduct you could not
excuse.&mdash;Do truth and principle require
such sacrifices?</p>

like remorse, for having lived only
for yourself&mdash;and sacrificed my peace
to inferior gratifications. In a comfortless
old age, you will remember
that you had one disinterested friend,
whose heart you wounded to the quick.
The hour of recollection will come&mdash;and
you will not be satisfied to act the
part of a boy, till you fall into that of a
dotard. I know that your mind, your
heart, and your principles of action,
are all superior to your present conduct.
You do, you must, respect me&mdash;and
you will be sorry to forfeit my esteem.</p>

involuntarily press on me, to be cleared
up by time.</p>

<p>You may render me unhappy; but
cannot make me contemptible in my
own eyes.&mdash;I shall still be able to support
my child, though I am disappointed
in some other plans of usefulness,
which I once believed would have afforded
you equal pleasure.</p>

my natural generosity, because I thought
your property in jeopardy.&mdash;When I

You tell me "that I torment you."&mdash;Why
do I?&mdash;&mdash;Because you cannot
estrange your heart entirely from me&mdash;and
you feel that justice is on my side.
You urge, "that your conduct was
unequivocal."&mdash;It was not.&mdash;When
your coolness has hurt me, with what
tenderness have you endeavoured to
remove the impression!&mdash;and even before
I returned to England, you took
great pains to convince me, that all
my uneasiness was occasioned by the
effect of a worn-out constitution&mdash;and
you concluded your letter with these
words, "Business alone has kept me
from you.&mdash;Come to any port, and I
will fly down to my two dear girls
with a heart all their own."</p>

<p>With these assurances, is it extraordinary
that I should believe what I

you had a struggle with old propensities;

that you had a magnanimity of character,
which would enable you to conquer
yourself.</p>

romance, you have acknowledged to
me feelings of this kind.&mdash;You could
restore me to life and hope, and the
satisfaction you would feel, would
amply repay you.</p>

own heart I pierce&mdash;and the time will
come, when you will lament that you
have thrown away a heart, that, even
in the moment of passion, you cannot

disdain to utter a reproach, though I

That there is "sophistry" on one
side or other, is certain; but now it
matters not on which. On my part it
has not been a question of words. Yet
your understanding or mine must be
strangely warped&mdash;for what you term
"delicacy," appears to me to be exactly
the contrary. I have no criterion
for morality, and have thought in vain,
if the sensations which lead you to follow
an ancle or step, be the sacred
foundation of principle and affection.
Mine has been of a very different nature,

brunt of your sarcasms.</p>

<p>The sentiment in me is still sacred.
If there be any part of me that will
survive the sense of my misfortunes, it
is the purity of my affections. The

<h3><a name="LETTER" id="LETTER"></a>LETTER</h3>

<h3><i>Introductory to a Series of Letters on the Present
Character of the French Nation.</i></h3>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="right">Paris, February 15, 1793.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear friend,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is necessary perhaps for an observer
of mankind, to guard as carefully the
remembrance of the first impression
made by a nation, as by a countenance;
because we imperceptibly lose sight of
the national character, when we become
more intimate with individuals.
It is not then useless or presumptuous
to note, that, when I first entered Paris,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-40" id="Pg_4-40"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-40.png">40</a>]</span>
the striking contrast of riches and poverty,
elegance and slovenliness, urbanity
and deceit, every where caught
my eye, and saddened my soul; and
these impressions are still the foundation
of my remarks on the manners, which
flatter the senses, more than they interest
the heart, and yet excite more interest
than esteem.</p>

<p>The whole mode of life here tends
indeed to render the people frivolous,
and, to borrow their favourite epithet,
amiable. Ever on the wing, they are
always sipping the sparkling joy on the
brim of the cup, leaving satiety in the
bottom for those who venture to drink
deep. On all sides they trip along,
buoyed up by animal spirits, and seemingly
so void of care, that often, when
I am walking on the <i>Boulevards</i>, it
occurs to me, that they alone understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-41" id="Pg_4-41"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-41.png">41</a>]</span>
the full import of the term leisure; and
they trifle their time away with such
an air of contentment, I know not how
to wish them wiser at the expence of
their gaiety. They play before me like
motes in a sunbeam, enjoying the passing
ray; whilst an English head, searching
for more solid happiness, loses, in
the analysis of pleasure, the volatile
sweets of the moment. Their chief
enjoyment, it is true, rises from vanity:
but it is not the vanity that engenders
vexation of spirit; on the contrary, it
lightens the heavy burthen of life,
which reason too often weighs, merely
to shift from one shoulder to the
other.</p>

<p>Investigating the modification of the
passion, as I would analyze the elements
that give a form to dead matter, I
shall attempt to trace to their source<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-42" id="Pg_4-42"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-42.png">42</a>]</span>
the causes which have combined to
render this nation the most polished, in
a physical sense, and probably the most
superficial in the world; and I mean to
follow the windings of the various
streams that disembogue into a terrific
gulf, in which all the dignity of our
nature is absorbed. For every thing
has conspired to make the French the
most sensual people in the world; and
what can render the heart so hard, or
so effectually stifle every moral emotion,
as the refinements of sensuality?</p>

<p>The frequent repetition of the word
French, appears invidious; let me then
make a previous observation, which I
beg you not to lose sight of, when I
speak rather harshly of a land flowing
with milk and honey. Remember that
it is not the morals of a particular
people that I would decry; for are we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-43" id="Pg_4-43"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-43.png">43</a>]</span>
not all of the same stock? But I wish
calmly to consider the stage of civilization
in which I find the French, and,
giving a sketch of their character, and
unfolding the circumstances which have
produced its identity, I shall endeavour
to throw some light on the history of
man, and on the present important
subjects of discussion.</p>

<p>I would I could first inform you that,
out of the chaos of vices and follies,
prejudices and virtues, rudely jumbled
together, I saw the fair form of Liberty
slowly rising, and Virtue expanding her
wings to shelter all her children! I
should then hear the account of the
barbarities that have rent the bosom of
France patiently, and bless the firm
hand that lopt off the rotten limbs.
But, if the aristocracy of birth is levelled
with the ground, only to make room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-44" id="Pg_4-44"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-44.png">44</a>]</span>
for that of riches, I am afraid that the
morals of the people will not be much
improved by the change, or the government
rendered less venal. Still it
is not just to dwell on the misery produced
by the present struggle, without
adverting to the standing evils of the
old system. I am grieved&mdash;sorely grieved&mdash;when
I think of the blood that has
stained the cause of freedom at Paris;
but I also hear the same live stream cry
aloud from the highways, through
which the retreating armies passed
with famine and death in their rear,
and I hide my face with awe before
the inscrutable ways of providence,
sweeping in such various directions the
besom of destruction over the sons of
men.</p>

<p>Before I came to France, I cherished,
you know, an opinion, that strong vir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-45" id="Pg_4-45"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-45.png">45</a>]</span>tues
might exist with the polished manners
produced by the progress of civilization;
and I even anticipated the
epoch, when, in the course of improvement,
men would labour to become
virtuous, without being goaded on by
misery. But now, the perspective of
the golden age, fading before the attentive
eye of observation, almost eludes
my sight; and, losing thus in part my
theory of a more perfect state, start not,
my friend, if I bring forward an opinion,
which at the first glance seems to
be levelled against the existence of God!
I am not become an Atheist, I assure
you, by residing at Paris: yet I begin
to fear that vice, or, if you will, evil,
is the grand mobile of action, and that,
when the passions are justly poized, we
become harmless, and in the same proportion
useless.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-46" id="Pg_4-46"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-46.png">46</a>]</span>
The wants of reason are very few;
and, were we to consider dispassionately
the real value of most things, we should
probably rest satisfied with the simple
gratification of our physical necessities,
and be content with negative goodness:
for it is frequently, only that wanton,
the Imagination, with her artful
coquetry, who lures us forward, and
makes us run over a rough road, pushing
aside every obstacle merely to catch
a disappointment.</p>

<p>The desire also of being useful to
others, is continually damped by experience;
and, if the exertions of humanity
were not in some measure their
own reward, who would endure misery,
or struggle with care, to make
some people ungrateful, and others
idle?</p>

<p>You will call these melancholy effu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-47" id="Pg_4-47"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-47.png">47</a>]</span>sions,
and guess that, fatigued by the
vivacity, which has all the bustling
folly of childhood, without the innocence
which renders ignorance charming,
I am too severe in my strictures.
It may be so; and I am aware that the
good effects of the revolution will be
last felt at Paris; where surely the soul
of Epicurus has long been at work to
root out the simple emotions of the
heart, which, being natural, are always
moral. Rendered cold and artificial
by the selfish enjoyments of the senses,
which the government fostered, is it
surprising that simplicity of manners,
and singleness of heart, rarely appear,
to recreate me with the wild odour of
nature, so passing sweet?</p>

<p>Seeing how deep the fibres of mischief
have shot, I sometimes ask, with a
doubting accent, Whether a nation can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-48" id="Pg_4-48"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-48.png">48</a>]</span>
go back to the purity of manners which
has hitherto been maintained unsullied
only by the keen air of poverty, when,
emasculated by pleasure, the luxuries
of prosperity are become the wants of
nature? I cannot yet give up the hope,
that a fairer day is dawning on Europe,
though I must hesitatingly observe, that
little is to be expected from the narrow
principle of commerce which seems
every where to be shoving aside <i>the point
of honour</i> of the <i>noblesse</i>. I can look beyond
the evils of the moment, and do
not expect muddied water to become
clear before it has had time to stand;
yet, even for the moment, it is the
most terrific of all sights, to see men
vicious without warmth&mdash;to see the
order that should be the superscription
of virtue, cultivated to give security to
crimes which only thoughtlessness could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-49" id="Pg_4-49"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-49.png">49</a>]</span>
palliate. Disorder is, in fact, the very
essence of vice, though with the wild
wishes of a corrupt fancy humane emotions
often kindly mix to soften their
atrocity. Thus humanity, generosity,
and even self-denial, sometimes render
a character grand, and even useful,
when hurried away by lawless passions;
but what can equal the turpitude of a
cold calculator who lives for himself
alone, and considering his fellow-creatures
merely as machines of pleasure,
never forgets that honesty is the best policy?
Keeping ever within the pale of
the law, he crushes his thousands with
impunity; but it is with that degree of
management, which makes him, to borrow
a significant vulgarism, a villain
<i>in grain</i>. The very excess of his depravation
preserves him, whilst the more
respectable beast of prey, who prowls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-50" id="Pg_4-50"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-50.png">50</a>]</span>
about like the lion, and roars to announce
his approach, falls into a snare.</p>

<p>You may think it too soon to form
an opinion of the future government,
yet it is impossible to avoid hazarding
some conjectures, when every thing
whispers me, that names, not principles,
are changed, and when I see that
the turn of the tide has left the dregs of
the old system to corrupt the new. For
the same pride of office, the same desire
of power are still visible; with this aggravation,
that, fearing to return to obscurity
after having but just acquired
a relish for distinction, each hero, or
philosopher, for all are dubbed with
these new titles, endeavours to make
hay while the sun shines; and every
petty municipal officer, become the idol,
or rather the tyrant of the day, stalks
like a cock on a dunghil.</p>

to foresee that I shall treat more of
morals than manners.</p>

<h3>ON THE</h3>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I ought</span> to apologize for not having
written to you on the subject you
mentioned; but, to tell you the truth,
it grew upon me: and, instead of an
answer, I have begun a series of letters
on the management of children in
their infancy. Replying then to your
question, I have the public in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-56" id="Pg_4-56"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-56.png">56</a>]</span>
thoughts, and shall endeavour to show
what modes appear to me necessary,
to render the infancy of children more
healthy and happy. I have long
thought, that the cause which renders
children as hard to rear as the most
fragile plant, is our deviation from
simplicity. I know that some able
physicians have recommended the method
I have pursued, and I mean to
point out the good effects I have observed
in practice. I am aware that
many matrons will exclaim against me,
and dwell on the number of children
they have brought up, as their mothers
did before them, without troubling
themselves with new-fangled notions;
yet, though, in my uncle Toby's words,
they should attempt to silence me, by
"wishing I had seen their large" families,
I must suppose, while a third part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-57" id="Pg_4-57"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-57.png">57</a>]</span>
of the human species, according to the
most accurate calculation, die during
their infancy, just at the threshold of
life, that there is some error in the
modes adopted by mothers and nurses,
which counteracts their own endeavours.
I may be mistaken in some
particulars; for general rules, founded
on the soundest reason, demand individual
modification; but, if I can persuade
any of the rising generation to
exercise their reason on this head, I am
content. My advice will probably
be found most useful to mothers in the
middle class; and it is from them that
the lower imperceptibly gains improvement.
Custom, produced by reason
in one, may safely be the effect of
imitation in the other.</p>

<h4>LETTER I</h4>

<p class="right">Dublin, April 14, [1787.]</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> still an invalid&mdash;and begin to
believe that I ought never to expect to
enjoy health. My mind preys on my
body&mdash;and, when I endeavour to be
useful, I grow too much interested for
my own peace. Confined almost entirely
to the society of children, I am
anxiously solicitous for their future
welfare, and mortified beyond measure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-62" id="Pg_4-62"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-62.png">62</a>]</span>
when counteracted in my endeavours to
improve them.&mdash;I feel all a mother's
fears for the swarm of little ones which
surround me, and observe disorders,
without having power to apply the
proper remedies. How can I be reconciled
to life, when it is always a
painful warfare, and when I am deprived
of all the pleasures I relish?&mdash;I
allude to rational conversations, and
domestic affections. Here, alone, a
poor solitary individual in a strange
land, tied to one spot, and subject to
the caprice of another, can I be contented?
I am desirous to convince you
that I have <i>some</i> cause for sorrow&mdash;and
am not without reason detached from
life. I shall hope to hear that you are
well, and am yours sincerely</p>

<h4>LETTER II</h4>

<p class="right">Henley, Thursday, Sept 13.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I saw you, I have, literally
speaking, <i>enjoyed</i> solitude. My sister
could not accompany me in my rambles;
I therefore wandered alone, by
the side of the Thames, and in the
neighbouring beautiful fields and
pleasure grounds: the prospects were
of such a placid kind, I <i>caught</i> tranquillity
while I surveyed them&mdash;my mind
was <i>still</i>, though active. Were I to
give you an account how I have spent
my time, you would smile.&mdash;I found an
old French bible here, and amused
myself with comparing it with our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-64" id="Pg_4-64"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-64.png">64</a>]</span>
English translation; then I would listen
to the falling leaves, or observe the
various tints the autumn gave to
them&mdash;At other times, the singing of
a robin, or the noise of a water-mill,
engaged my attention&mdash;partial attention&mdash;,
for I was, at the same time
perhaps discussing some knotty point,
or straying from this <i>tiny</i> world to new
systems. After these excursions, I returned
to the family meals, told the
children stories (they think me <i>vastly</i>
agreeable), and my sister was amused.&mdash;Well,
will you allow me to call this
way of passing my days pleasant?</p>

<p>I was just going to mend my pen;
but I believe it will enable me to say
all I have to add to this epistle. Have
you yet heard of an habitation for me?
I often think of my new plan of life;
and, lest my sister should try to prevail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-65" id="Pg_4-65"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-65.png">65</a>]</span>
on me to alter it, I have avoided mentioning
it to her. I am determined!&mdash;Your
sex generally laugh at female
determinations; but let me tell you,
I never yet resolved to do, any thing of
consequence, that I did not adhere resolutely
to it, till I had accomplished
my purpose, improbable as it might
have appeared to a more timid mind.
In the course of near nine-and-twenty
years, I have gathered some experience,
and felt many <i>severe</i> disappointments&mdash;and
what is the amount? I long for a
little peace and <i>independence</i>! Every
obligation we receive from our fellow-creatures
is a new shackle, takes from
our native freedom, and debases the
mind, makes us mere earthworms&mdash;I
am not fond of grovelling!</p>

<p class="right">I am, sir, yours, &amp;c.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary wollstonecraft.</span></p>

<h4>LETTER III</h4>

<p class="right">Market Harborough, Sept. 20.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> left me with three opulent
tradesmen; their conversation was not
calculated to beguile the way, when
the sable curtain concealed the beauties
of nature. I listened to the tricks
of trade&mdash;and shrunk away, without
wishing to grow rich; even the novelty
of the subjects did not render them
pleasing; fond as I am of tracing the
passions in all their different forms&mdash;I
was not surprised by any glimpse of the
sublime, or beautiful&mdash;though one of
them imagined I would be a useful partner
in a good <i>firm</i>. I was very much
fatigued, and have scarcely recovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-67" id="Pg_4-67"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-67.png">67</a>]</span>
myself. I do not expect to enjoy the
same tranquil pleasures Henley afforded:
I meet with new objects to employ
my mind; but many painful emotions
are complicated with the reflections
they give rise to.</p>

<p>I do not intend to enter on the <i>old</i>
topic, yet hope to hear from you&mdash;and
am yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary wollstonecraft.</span></p>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER IV</h4>

<p class="right">Friday Night.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> your remarks are generally
judicious&mdash;I cannot <i>now</i> concur with you,
I mean with respect to the preface<a name="FNanchor_67-A_21" id="FNanchor_67-A_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_67-A_21" class="fnanchor">[67-A]</a>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-68" id="Pg_4-68"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-68.png">68</a>]</span>
and have not altered it. I hate the
usual smooth way of exhibiting proud
humility. A general rule <i>only</i> extends
to the majority&mdash;and, believe me, the
few judicious parents who may peruse
my book, will not feel themselves hurt&mdash;and
the weak are too vain to mind what
is said in a book intended for children.</p>

<p>I return you the Italian MS.&mdash;but
do not hastily imagine that I am indolent.
I would not spare any labour to
do my duty&mdash;and, after the most laborious
day, that single thought would
solace me more than any pleasures the
senses could enjoy. I find I could not
translate the MS. well. If it was not
a MS, I should not be so easily intimidated;
but the hand, and errors in
orthography, or abbreviations, are a
stumbling-block at the first setting
out.&mdash;I cannot bear to do any thing I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-69" id="Pg_4-69"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-69.png">69</a>]</span>
cannot do well&mdash;and I should lose time
in the vain attempt.</p>

<p>I had, the other day, the satisfaction
of again receiving a letter from my
poor, dear Margaret<a name="FNanchor_69-A_22" id="FNanchor_69-A_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_69-A_22" class="fnanchor">[69-A]</a>.&mdash;With all a
mother's fondness I could transcribe a
part of it&mdash;She says, every day her
affection to me, and dependence on
heaven increase, &amp;c.&mdash;I miss her
innocent caresses&mdash;and sometimes indulge
a pleasing hope, that she may be
allowed to cheer my childless age&mdash;if
I am to live to be old.&mdash;At any rate, I
may hear of the virtues I may not contemplate&mdash;and
my reason may permit
me to love a female.&mdash;I now allude to
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. I have received another letter
from her, and her childish complaints
vex me&mdash;indeed they do&mdash;As
usual, good-night.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary.</span></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-70" id="Pg_4-70"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-70.png">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>If parents attended to their children,
I would not have written the stories;
for, what are books&mdash;compared to conversations
which affection inforces!&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER V</h4>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remember</span> you are to settle <i>my account</i>,
as I want to know how much I
am in your debt&mdash;but do not suppose
that I feel any uneasiness on that score.
The generality of people in trade
would not be much obliged to me for a
like civility, <i>but you were a man</i> before
you were a bookseller&mdash;so I am your
sincere friend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-71" id="Pg_4-71"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-71.png">71</a>]</span></p>
<h4>LETTER VI</h4>

<p class="right">Friday Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> sick with vexation&mdash;and wish
I could knock my foolish head against
the wall, that bodily pain might make
me feel less anguish from self-reproach!
To say the truth, I was never more displeased
with myself, and I will tell you
the cause.&mdash;You may recollect that I
did not mention to you the circumstance
of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; having a fortune left
to him; nor did a hint of it drop from
me when I conversed with my sister;
because I knew he had a sufficient motive
for concealing it. Last Sunday,
when his character was aspersed, as I
thought, unjustly, in the heat of vindi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-72" id="Pg_4-72"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-72.png">72</a>]</span>cation
I informed ****** that he was
now independent; but, at the same
time, desired him not to repeat my information
to B&mdash;&mdash;; yet, last Tuesday,
he told him all&mdash;and the boy at B&mdash;&mdash;'s
gave Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; an account of it. As
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; knew he had only made a
confident of me (I blush to think of it!)
he guessed the channel of intelligence,
and this morning came (not to reproach
me, I wish he had!) but to point out the
injury I have done him.&mdash;Let what will
be the consequence, I will reimburse
him, if I deny myself the necessaries of
life&mdash;and even then my folly will sting
me.&mdash;Perhaps you can scarcely conceive
the misery I at this moment
endure&mdash;that I, whose power of doing
good is so limited, should do harm, galls
my very soul. ****** may laugh at
these qualms&mdash;but, supposing Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-73" id="Pg_4-73"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-73.png">73</a>]</span>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to be unworthy, I am not
the less to blame. Surely it is hell to
despise one's self!&mdash;I did not want this
additional vexation&mdash;at this time I have
many that hang heavily on my spirits.
I shall not call on you this month&mdash;nor
stir out.&mdash;My stomach has been so suddenly
and violently affected, I am
unable to lean over the desk.</p>

<h4>LETTER VII</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I am become a reviewer, I think
it right, in the way of business, to consider
the subject. You have alarmed
the editor of the Critical, as the advertisement
prefixed to the Appendix<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-74" id="Pg_4-74"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-74.png">74</a>]</span>
plainly shows. The Critical appears
to me to be a timid, mean production,
and its success is a reflection on the
taste and judgment of the public; but,
as a body, who ever gave it credit for
much? The voice of the people is only
the voice of truth, when some man of
abilities has had time to get fast hold of
the <span class="smcap">great nose</span> of the monster. Of
course, local fame is generally a
clamour, and dies away. The Appendix
to the Monthly afforded me more
amusement, though every article almost
wants energy and a <i>cant</i> of virtue and
liberality is strewed over it; always
tame, and eager to pay court to established
fame. The account of Necker
is one unvaried tone of admiration.
Surely men were born only to provide
for the sustenance of the body by enfeebling
the mind!</p>

<h4>LETTER VIII</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> made me very low-spirited last
night, by your manner of talking.&mdash;You
are my only friend&mdash;the only
person I am <i>intimate</i> with.&mdash;I never had
a father, or a brother&mdash;you have been
both to me, ever since I knew you&mdash;yet
I have sometimes been very petulant.&mdash;I
have been thinking of those instances
of ill-humour and quickness, and they
appeared like crimes.</p>

<h4>LETTER IX</h4>

<p class="right">Saturday Night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> a mere animal, and instinctive
emotions too often silence the suggestions
of reason. Your note&mdash;I can
scarcely tell why, hurt me&mdash;and produced
a kind of winterly smile, which
diffuses a beam of despondent tranquillity
over the features. I have been
very ill&mdash;Heaven knows it was more
than fancy&mdash;After some sleepless, wearisome
nights, towards the morning I
have grown delirious.&mdash;Last Thursday,
in particular, I imagined &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was
thrown into great distress by his folly;
and I, unable to assist him, was in an
agony. My nerves were in such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-77" id="Pg_4-77"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-77.png">77</a>]</span>
painful state of irritation&mdash;I suffered
more than I can express&mdash;Society was
necessary&mdash;and might have diverted
me till I gained more strength; but I
blushed when I recollected how often
I had teazed you with childish complaints,
and the reveries of a disordered
imagination. I even <i>imagined</i> that I
intruded on you, because you never
called on me&mdash;though you perceived
that I was not well.&mdash;I have nourished
a sickly kind of delicacy, which gives
me many unnecessary pangs.&mdash;I acknowledge
that life is but a jest&mdash;and
often a frightful dream&mdash;yet catch
myself every day searching for something
serious&mdash;and feel real misery
from the disappointment. I am a
strange compound of weakness and resolution!
However, if I must suffer, I
will endeavour to suffer in silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-78" id="Pg_4-78"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-78.png">78</a>]</span>
There is certainly a great defect in my
mind&mdash;my wayward heart creates its
own misery&mdash;Why I am made thus I
cannot tell; and, till I can form some
idea of the whole of my existence, I
must be content to weep and dance
like a child&mdash;long for a toy, and be
tired of it as soon as I get it.</p>

<p>We must each of us wear a fool's
cap; but mine, alas! has lost its bells,
and is grown so heavy, I find it intolerably
troublesome.&mdash;&mdash;Good-night!
I have been pursuing a number of
strange thoughts since I began to write,
and have actually both wept and
laughed immoderately&mdash;Surely I am a
fool&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I thought</span> you <i>very</i> unkind, nay,

cold in wisdom's

perhaps never disregarded
an almost broken heart, especially when
a respect, a practical respect, for virtue,
sharpened the wounds of adversity. I

to support that body&mdash;God of heaven,

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you left me this morning, and
I reflected a moment&mdash;your <i>officious</i>
message, which at first appeared to me
a joke&mdash;looked so very like an insult&mdash;I
cannot forget it&mdash;To prevent then the
necessity of forcing a smile&mdash;when I
chance to meet you&mdash;I take the earliest
opportunity of informing you of my
real sentiments.</p>

<h4>LETTER XIII</h4>

<p class="right">Wednesday, 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is inexpressibly disagreeable to me
to be obliged to enter again on a subject,
that has already raised a tumult of
<i>indignant</i> emotions in my bosom, which
I was labouring to suppress when I received
your letter. I shall now <i>condescend</i>
to answer your epistle; but let me
first tell you, that, in my <i>unprotected</i> situation,
I make a point of never forgiving
a <i>deliberate insult</i>&mdash;and in that light I
consider your late officious conduct.
It is not according to my nature to
mince matters&mdash;I will then tell you in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-86" id="Pg_4-86"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-86.png">86</a>]</span>
plain terms, what I think. I have ever
considered you in the light of a <i>civil</i>
acquaintance&mdash;on the word friend I lay
a peculiar emphasis&mdash;and, as a mere
acquaintance, you were rude and <i>cruel</i>,
to step forward to insult a woman,
whose conduct and misfortunes demand
respect. If my friend, Mr. Johnson,
had made the proposal&mdash;I should have
been severely hurt&mdash;have thought him
unkind and unfeeling, but not <i>impertinent</i>.&mdash;The
privilege of intimacy you
had no claim to&mdash;and should have referred
the man to myself&mdash;if you had
not sufficient discernment to quash it at
once. I am, sir, poor and destitute.&mdash;Yet
I have a spirit that will never bend,
or take indirect methods, to obtain the
consequence I despise; nay, if to support
life it was necessary to act contrary
to my principles, the struggle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-87" id="Pg_4-87"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-87.png">87</a>]</span>
would soon be over. I can bear any
thing but my own contempt.</p>

<p>In a few words, what I call an insult,
is the bare supposition that I could for
a moment think of <i>prostituting</i> my person
for a maintenance; for in that point of
view does such a marriage appear to
me, who consider right and wrong in
the abstract, and never by words and
local opinions shield myself from the
reproaches of my own heart and understanding.</p>

<p>It is needless to say more&mdash;Only you
must excuse me when I add, that I wish
never to see, but as a perfect stranger,
a person who could so grossly mistake
my character. An apology is not necessary&mdash;if
you were inclined to make
one&mdash;nor any further expostulations.&mdash;I
again repeat, I cannot overlook an
affront; few indeed have sufficient de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-88" id="Pg_4-88"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-88.png">88</a>]</span>licacy
to respect poverty, even where
it gives lustre to a character&mdash;and I tell
you sir, I am <span class="smcap">poor</span>&mdash;yet can live without
your benevolent exertions.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary wollstonecraft.</span></p>

<h4>LETTER XIV</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I send</span> you <i>all</i> the books I had to review
except Dr. J&mdash;'s Sermons, which
I have begun. If you wish me to look
over any more trash this month&mdash;you
must send it directly. I have been so
low-spirited since I saw you&mdash;I was
quite glad, last night, to feel myself affected
by some passages in Dr. J&mdash;'s
sermon on the death of his wife&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-89" id="Pg_4-89"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-89.png">89</a>]</span>

has been for some time I cannot
tell where. Send me the Speaker&mdash;and
<i>Mary</i>, I want one&mdash;and I shall soon
want some paper&mdash;you may as well
send it at the same time&mdash;for I am trying
to brace my nerves that I may be
industrious.&mdash;I am afraid reason is not a
good bracer&mdash;for I have been reasoning
a long time with my untoward spirits&mdash;and
yet my hand trembles.&mdash;I could
finish a period very <i>prettily</i> now, by saying
that it ought to be steady when I
add that I am yours sincerely,</p>

<p>If you do not like the manner in
which I reviewed Dr. J&mdash;'s s&mdash;&mdash; on

not do it any other way&mdash;I felt some
pleasure in paying a just tribute of re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-90" id="Pg_4-90"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-90.png">90</a>]</span>spect
to the memory of a man&mdash;who,
spite of his faults, I have an affection

gadding perhaps;&mdash;but <i>you</i> do not live

<h4>LETTER XV</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> dear sir, I send you a chapter
which I am pleased with, now I see it
in one point of view&mdash;and, as I have
made free with the author, I hope you
will not have often to say&mdash;what does
this mean?</p>

<p>You forgot you were to make out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-91" id="Pg_4-91"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-91.png">91</a>]</span>
my account&mdash;I am, of course, over
head and ears in debt; but I have not
that kind of pride, which makes some
dislike to be obliged to those they respect.&mdash;On
the contrary, when I involuntarily
lament that I have not a father
or brother, I thankfully recollect that
I have received unexpected kindness
from you and a few others.&mdash;So reason
allows, what nature impels me to&mdash;for
I cannot live without loving my fellow-creatures&mdash;nor
can I love them, without
discovering some virtue.</p>

<h4>LETTER XVI</h4>

<p class="right">Paris, December 26, 1792.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I should</span> immediately on the receipt
of your letter, my dear friend, have
thanked you for your punctuality, for it
highly gratified me, had I not wished
to wait till I could tell you that this
day was not stained with blood. Indeed
the prudent precautions taken by
the National Convention to prevent a
tumult, made me suppose that the dogs
of faction would not dare to bark, much
less to bite, however true to their scent;
and I was not mistaken; for the citizens,
who were all called out, are returning
home with composed counte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-93" id="Pg_4-93"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-93.png">93</a>]</span>nances,
shouldering their arms. About
nine o'clock this morning, the king
passed by my window, moving silently
along (excepting now and then a few
strokes on the drum, which rendered
the stillness more awful) through empty
streets, surrounded by the national guards,
who, clustering round the carriage,
seemed to deserve their name. The
inhabitants flocked to their windows,
but the casements were all shut, not a
voice was heard, nor did I see any
thing like an insulting gesture.&mdash;For
the first time since I entered France,
I bowed to the majesty of the people,
and respected the propriety of behaviour
so perfectly in unison with my own
feelings. I can scarcely tell you why,
but an association of ideas made the
tears flow insensibly from my eyes,
when I saw Louis sitting, with more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-94" id="Pg_4-94"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-94.png">94</a>]</span>
dignity than I expected from his character,
in a hackney coach, going to
meet death, where so many of his race
have triumphed. My fancy instantly
brought Louis XIV before me, entering
the capital with all his pomp, after
one of the victories most flattering to
his pride, only to see the sunshine of
prosperity overshadowed by the sublime
gloom of misery. I have been alone
ever since; and, though my mind is
calm, I cannot dismiss the lively images
that have filled my imagination all the
day.&mdash;Nay, do not smile, but pity me;
for, once or twice, lifting my eyes from
the paper, I have seen eyes glare
through a glass-door opposite my chair
and bloody hands shook at me. Not
the distant sound of a footstep can I
hear.&mdash;My apartments are remote from
those of the servants, the only persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-95" id="Pg_4-95"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-95.png">95</a>]</span>
who sleep with me in an immense hotel,
one folding door opening after another.&mdash;I
wish I had even kept the cat with
me!&mdash;I want to see something alive;
death in so many frightful shapes has
taken hold of my fancy.&mdash;I am going to
bed&mdash;and, for the first time in my life, I
cannot put out the candle.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<h2><a name="V4_CHAP_I" id="V4_CHAP_I"></a>CHAP. I.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Ye</span> who expect constancy where every
thing is changing, and peace in the
midst of tumult, attend to the voice of
experience, and mark in time the footsteps
of disappointment, or life will be
lost in desultory wishes, and death arrive

<p>In a sequestered valley, surrounded by
rocky mountains that intercepted many
of the passing clouds, though sunbeams
variegated their ample sides, lived a
sage, to whom nature had unlocked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-100" id="Pg_4-100"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-100.png">100</a>]</span>
her most hidden secrets. His hollow
eyes, sunk in their orbits, retired from
the view of vulgar objects, and turned
inwards, overleaped the boundary prescribed
to human knowledge. Intense
thinking during fourscore and ten years,
had whitened the scattered locks on
his head, which, like the summit of
the distant mountain, appeared to be
bound by an eternal frost.</p>

<p>On the sandy waste behind the mountains,
the track of ferocious beasts
might be traced, and sometimes the
mangled limbs which they left, attracted
a hovering flight of birds of prey. An
extensive wood the sage had forced to
rear its head in a soil by no means congenial,
and the firm trunks of the trees
seemed to frown with defiance on time;
though the spoils of innumerable summers
covered the roots, which resembled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-101" id="Pg_4-101"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-101.png">101</a>]</span>
fangs; so closely did they cling to the
unfriendly sand, where serpents hissed,
and snakes, rolling out their vast folds,
inhaled the noxious vapours. The ravens
and owls who inhabited the solitude,
gave also a thicker gloom to the
everlasting twilight, and the croaking
of the former a monotony, in unison
with the gloom; whilst lions and tygers,
shunning even this faint semblance of
day, sought the dark caverns, and at
night, when they shook off sleep, their
roaring would make the whole valley
resound, confounded with the screechings
of the bird of night.</p>

<p>One mountain rose sublime, towering
above all, on the craggy sides of which
a few sea-weeds grew, washed by the
ocean, that with tumultuous roar rushed
to assault, and even undermine, the
huge barrier that stopped its progress;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-102" id="Pg_4-102"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-102.png">102</a>]</span>
and ever and anon a ponderous mass,
loosened from the cliff, to which it
scarcely seemed to adhere, always threatening
to fall, fell into the flood, rebounding
as it fell, and the sound was re-echoed
from rock to rock. Look where
you would, all was without form, as
if nature, suddenly stopping her hand,
had left chaos a retreat.</p>

<p>Close to the most remote side of it
was the sage's abode. It was a rude
hut, formed of stumps of trees and
matted twigs, to secure him from the
inclemency of the weather; only through
small apertures crossed with rushes, the
wind entered in wild murmurs, modulated
by these obstructions. A clear
spring broke out of the middle of the
adjacent rock, which, dropping slowly
into a cavity it had hollowed, soon
overflowed, and then ran, struggling to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-103" id="Pg_4-103"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-103.png">103</a>]</span>
free itself from the cumbrous fragments,
till, become a deep, silent stream, it
escaped through reeds, and roots of
trees, whose blasted tops overhung and
darkened the current.</p>

<p>One side of the hut was supported by
the rock, and at midnight, when the
sage struck the inclosed part, it yawned
wide, and admitted him into a cavern in
the very bowels of the earth, where
never human foot before had trod; and
the various spirits, which inhabit the
different regions of nature, were here
obedient to his potent word. The cavern
had been formed by the great
inundation of waters, when the approach
of a comet forced them from
their source; then, when the fountains
of the great deep were broken up,
a stream rushed out of the centre of the
earth, where the spirits, who have lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-104" id="Pg_4-104"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-104.png">104</a>]</span>
on it, are confined to purify themselves
from the dross contracted in their first
stage of existence; and it flowed in
black waves, for ever bubbling along
the cave, the extent of which had never
been explored. From the sides and
top, water distilled, and, petrifying as
it fell, took fantastic shapes, that soon
divided it into apartments, if so they
might be called. In the foam, a wearied
spirit would sometimes rise, to catch
the most distant glimpse of light, or
taste the vagrant breeze, which the
yawning of the rock admitted, when
Sagestus, for that was the name of the
hoary sage, entered. Some, who were
refined and almost cleared from vicious
spots, he would allow to leave, for a limited
time, their dark prison-house;
and, flying on the winds across the bleak
northern ocean, or rising in an exhala<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-105" id="Pg_4-105"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-105.png">105</a>]</span>tion
till they reached a sun-beam, they
thus re-visited the haunts of men. These
were the guardian angels, who in soft
whispers restrain the vicious, and animate
the wavering wretch who stands
suspended between virtue and vice.</p>

<p>Sagestus had spent a night in the cavern,
as he often did, and he left the
silent vestibule of the grave, just as the
sun, emerging from the ocean, dispersed
the clouds, which were not half
so dense as those he had left. All that
was human in him rejoiced at the sight
of reviving life, and he viewed with
pleasure the mounting sap rising to expand
the herbs, which grew spontaneously
in this wild&mdash;when, turning his
eyes towards the sea, he found that
death had been at work during his absence,
and terrific marks of a furious
storm still spread horror around. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-106" id="Pg_4-106"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-106.png">106</a>]</span>
the day was serene, and threw bright
rays on eyes for ever shut, it dawned
not for the wretches who hung pendent
on the craggy rocks, or were stretched
lifeless on the sand. Some, struggling,
had dug themselves a grave; others
had resigned their breath before the
impetuous surge whirled them on shore.
A few, in whom the vital spark was
not so soon dislodged, had clung to
loose fragments; it was the grasp of
death; embracing the stone, they stiffened;
and the head, no longer erect,
rested on the mass which the arms encircled.
It felt not the agonizing gripe,
nor heard the sigh that broke the heart
in twain.</p>

<p>Resting his chin on an oaken club,
the sage looked on every side, to see
if he could discern any who yet breathed.
He drew nearer, and thought he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-107" id="Pg_4-107"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-107.png">107</a>]</span>
saw, at the first glance, the unclosed eyes
glare; but soon perceived that they
were a mere glassy substance, mute as
the tongue; the jaws were fallen, and,
in some of the tangled locks, hands
were clinched; nay, even the nails
had entered sharpened by despair. The
blood flew rapidly to his heart; it was
flesh; he felt he was still a man, and
the big tear paced down his iron cheeks,
whose muscles had not for a long time
been relaxed by such humane emotions.
A moment he breathed quick, then
heaved a sigh, and his wonted calm
returned with an unaccustomed glow
of tenderness; for the ways of heaven
were not hid from him; he lifted up
his eyes to the common Father of nature,
and all was as still in his bosom, as
the smooth deep, after having closed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-108" id="Pg_4-108"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-108.png">108</a>]</span>
over the huge vessel from which the
wretches had fled.</p>

<p>Turning round a part of the rock
that jutted out, meditating on the ways
of Providence, a weak infantine voice
reached his ears; it was lisping out the
name of mother. He looked, and beheld
a blooming child leaning over, and
kissing with eager fondness, lips that
were insensible to the warm pressure.
Starting at the sight of the sage, she
fixed her eyes on him, "Wake her,
ah! wake her," she cried, "or the
sea will catch us." Again he felt compassion,
for he saw that the mother
slept the sleep of death. He stretched
out his hand, and, smoothing his brow,
invited her to approach; but she still
intreated him to wake her mother,
whom she continued to call, with an
impatient tremulous voice. To detach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-109" id="Pg_4-109"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-109.png">109</a>]</span>
her from the body by persuasion would
not have been very easy. Sagestus had
a quicker method to effect his purpose;
he took out a box which contained a
soporific powder, and as soon as the
fumes reached her brain, the powers of
life were suspended.</p>

<p>He carried her directly to his hut,
and left her sleeping profoundly on his
rushy couch.</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-110" id="Pg_4-110"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-110.png">110</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="V4_CHAP_II" id="V4_CHAP_II"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> Sagestus approached the
dead, to view them with a more scrutinizing
eye. He was perfectly acquainted
with the construction of the
human body, knew the traces that virtue
or vice leaves on the whole frame;
they were now indelibly fixed by death;
nay more, he knew by the shape of
the solid structure, how far the spirit
could range, and saw the barrier beyond
which it could not pass: the mazes of
fancy he explored, measured the stretch
of thought, and, weighing all in an
even balance, could tell whom nature
had stamped an hero, a poet, or philosopher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-111" id="Pg_4-111"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-111.png">111</a>]</span>
By their appearance, at a transient
glance, he knew that the vessel must
have contained many passengers, and
that some of them were above the vulgar,
with respect to fortune and education;
he then walked leisurely among
the dead, and narrowly observed their
pallid features.</p>

<p>His eye first rested on a form in which
proportion reigned, and, stroking back
the hair, a spacious forehead met his
view; warm fancy had revelled there,
and her airy dance had left vestiges,
scarcely visible to a mortal eye. Some
perpendicular lines pointed out that
melancholy had predominated in his
constitution; yet the straggling hairs
of his eye-brows showed that anger had
often shook his frame; indeed, the
four temperatures, like the four elements,
had resided in this little world,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-112" id="Pg_4-112"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-112.png">112</a>]</span>
and produced harmony. The whole
visage was bony, and an energetic
frown had knit the flexible skin of his
brow; the kingdom within had been
extensive; and the wild creations of
fancy had there "a local habitation
and a name." So exquisite was his
sensibility, so quick his comprehension,
that he perceived various combinations
in an instant; he caught truth as she
darted towards him, saw all her fair
proportion at a glance, and the flash of
his eye spoke the quick senses which
conveyed intelligence to his mind; the
sensorium indeed was capacious, and
the sage imagined he saw the lucid
beam, sparkling with love or ambition,
in characters of fire, which a graceful
curve of the upper eyelid shaded. The
lips were a little deranged by contempt;
and a mixture of vanity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-113" id="Pg_4-113"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-113.png">113</a>]</span>
self-complacency formed a few irregular
lines round them. The chin had
suffered from sensuality, yet there were
still great marks of vigour in it, as if
advanced with stern dignity. The
hand accustomed to command, and even
tyrannize, was unnerved; but its appearance
convinced Sagestus, that he
had oftener wielded a thought than a
weapon; and that he had silenced, by
irresistible conviction, the superficial
disputant, and the being, who doubted
because he had not strength to believe,
who, wavering between different borrowed
opinions, first caught at one
straw, then at another, unable to settle
into any consistency of character. After
gazing a few moments, Sagestus turned
away exclaiming, How are the stately
oaks torn up by a tempest, and the bow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-114" id="Pg_4-114"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-114.png">114</a>]</span>
unstrung, that could force the arrow
beyond the ken of the eye!</p>

<p>What a different face next met his
view! The forehead was short, yet well
set together; the nose small, but a little
turned up at the end; and a draw-down
at the sides of his mouth, proved that
he had been a humourist, who minded
the main chance, and could joke with
his acquaintance, while he eagerly devoured
a dainty which he was not to
pay for. His lips shut like a box whose
hinges had often been mended; and
the muscles, which display the soft emotion
of the heart on the cheeks, were
grown quite rigid, so that, the vessels
that should have moistened them not
having much communication with the
grand source of passions, the fine volatile
fluid had evaporated, and they
became mere dry fibres, which might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-115" id="Pg_4-115"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-115.png">115</a>]</span>
be pulled by any misfortune that
threatened himself, but were not sufficiently
elastic to be moved by the
miseries of others. His joints were
inserted compactly, and with celerity
they had performed all the animal
functions, without any of the grace
which results from the imagination
mixing with the senses.</p>

<p>A huge form was stretched near him,
that exhibited marks of overgrown
infancy; every part was relaxed; all
appeared imperfect. Yet, some undulating
lines on the puffed-out cheeks,
displayed signs of timid, servile good
nature; and the skin of the forehead
had been so often drawn up by wonder,
that the few hairs of the eyebrows were
fixed in a sharp arch, whilst an ample
chin rested in lobes of flesh on his protuberant
breast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-116" id="Pg_4-116"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-116.png">116</a>]</span>
By his side was a body that had
scarcely ever much life in it&mdash;sympathy
seemed to have drawn them together&mdash;every
feature and limb was round and
fleshy, and, if a kind of brutal cunning
had not marked the face, it might have
been mistaken for an automaton, so unmixed
was the phlegmatic fluid. The
vital spark was buried deep in a soft
mass of matter, resembling the pith in
young elder, which, when found, is so
equivocal, that it only appears a moister
part of the same body.</p>

<p>Another part of the beach was
covered with sailors, whose bodies exhibited
marks of strength and brutal
courage.&mdash;Their characters were all
different, though of the same class;
Sagestus did not stay to discriminate
them, satisfied with a rough sketch.
He saw indolence roused by a love of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-117" id="Pg_4-117"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-117.png">117</a>]</span>
humour, or rather bodily fun; sensuality
and prodigality with a vein of generosity
running through it; a contempt
of danger with gross superstition;
supine senses, only to be kept alive by
noisy, tumultuous pleasures, or that
kind of novelty which borders on absurdity:
this formed the common outline,
and the rest were rather dabs than
shades.</p>

<p>Sagestus paused, and remembered it
had been said by an earthly wit, that
"many a flower is born to blush unseen,
and waste its sweetness on the
desart air." How little, he exclaimed,
did that poet know of the ways of
heaven! And yet, in this respect, they
are direct; the hands before me, were
designed to pull a rope, knock down a
sheep, or perform the servile offices of
life; no "mute, inglorious poet" rests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-118" id="Pg_4-118"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-118.png">118</a>]</span>
amongst them, and he who is superior
to his fellow, does not rise above mediocrity.
The genius that sprouts from
a dunghil soon shakes off the heterogenous
mass; those only grovel, who
have not power to fly.</p>

<p>He turned his step towards the mother
of the orphan: another female
was at some distance; and a man who,
by his garb, might have been the husband,
or brother, of the former, was
not far off.</p>

<p>Him the sage surveyed with an attentive
eye, and bowed with respect
to the inanimate clay, that lately had
been the dwelling of a most benevolent
spirit. The head was square, though
the features were not very prominent;
but there was a great harmony in every
part, and the turn of the nostrils and
lips evinced, that the soul must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-119" id="Pg_4-119"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-119.png">119</a>]</span>
had taste, to which they had served as
organs. Penetration and judgment
were seated on the brows that overhung
the eye. Fixed as it was, Sagestus
quickly discerned the expression
it must have had; dark and pensive,
rather from slowness of comprehension
than melancholy, it seemed to absorb
the light of knowledge, to drink it in
ray by ray; nay, a new one was not
allowed to enter his head till the last
was arranged: an opinion was thus
cautiously received, and maturely
weighed, before it was added to the
general stock. As nature led him to
mount from a part to the whole, he
was most conversant with the beautiful,
and rarely comprehended the sublime;
yet, said Sagestus, with a softened tone,
he was all heart, full of forbearance, and
desirous to please every fellow-creature;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-120" id="Pg_4-120"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-120.png">120</a>]</span>
but from a nobler motive than a love
of admiration; the fumes of vanity
never mounted to cloud his brain, or
tarnish his beneficence. The fluid in
which those placid eyes swam, is now
congealed; how often has tenderness
given them the finest water! Some
torn parts of the child's dress hung
round his arm, which led the sage to
conclude, that he had saved the child;
every line in his face confirmed the
conjecture; benevolence indeed strung
the nerves that naturally were not
very firm; it was the great knot that
tied together the scattered qualities,
and gave the distinct stamp to the character.</p>

<p>The female whom he next approached,
and supposed to be an attendant on
the other, was below the middle size,
and her legs were so disproportionably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-121" id="Pg_4-121"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-121.png">121</a>]</span>
short, that, when she moved, she must
have waddled along; her elbows were
drawn in to touch her long taper, waist,
and the air of her whole body was an
affectation of gentility. Death could
not alter the rigid hang of her limbs, or
efface the simper that had stretched her
mouth; the lips were thin, as if nature
intended she should mince her words;
her nose was small, and sharp at the
end; and the forehead, unmarked by
eyebrows, was wrinkled by the discontent
that had sunk her cheeks, on
which Sagestus still discerned faint
traces of tenderness; and fierce good-nature,
he perceived had sometimes
animated the little spark of an eye that
anger had oftener lighted. The same
thought occurred to him that the sight
of the sailors had suggested, Men and
women are all in their proper places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-122" id="Pg_4-122"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-122.png">122</a>]</span>&mdash;this
female was intended to fold up
linen and nurse the sick.</p>

<p>Anxious to observe the mother of
his charge, he turned to the lily that
had been so rudely snapped, and, carefully
observing it, traced every fine line
to its source. There was a delicacy in
her form, so truly feminine, that an involuntary
desire to cherish such a being,
made the sage again feel the almost forgotten
sensations of his nature. On
observing her more closely, he discovered
that her natural delicacy had been
increased by an improper education,
to a degree that took away all vigour
from her faculties. And its baneful
influence had had such an effect on her
mind, that few traces of the exertions
of it appeared on her face, though the
fine finish of her features, and particularly
the form of the forehead, con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-123" id="Pg_4-123"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-123.png">123</a>]</span>vinced
the sage that her understanding
might have risen considerably above
mediocrity, had the wheels ever been
put in motion; but, clogged by prejudices,
they never turned quite round,
and, whenever she considered a subject,
she stopped before she came to a conclusion.
Assuming a mask of propriety,
she had banished nature; yet
its tendency was only to be diverted,
not stifled. Some lines, which took
from the symmetry of the mouth, not
very obvious to a superficial observer,
struck Sagestus, and they appeared to
him characters of indolent obstinacy.
Not having courage to form an opinion
of her own, she adhered, with blind
partiality, to those she adopted, which
she received in the lump, and, as they
always remained unopened, of course
she only saw the even gloss on the out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-124" id="Pg_4-124"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-124.png">124</a>]</span>side.
Vestiges of anger were visible on
her brow, and the sage concluded, that
she had often been offended with, and
indeed would scarcely make any allowance
for, those who did not coincide
with her in opinion, as things always
appear self-evident that have never
been examined; yet her very weakness
gave a charming timidity to her countenance;
goodness and tenderness pervaded
every lineament, and melted in
her dark blue eyes. The compassion
that wanted activity, was sincere, though
it only embellished her face, or produced
casual acts of charity when a
moderate alms could relieve present
distress. Unacquainted with life, fictitious,
unnatural distress drew the tears
that were not shed for real misery. In
its own shape, human wretchedness
excites a little disgust in the mind that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-125" id="Pg_4-125"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-125.png">125</a>]</span>
has indulged sickly refinement. Perhaps
the sage gave way to a little conjecture
in drawing the last conclusion;
but his conjectures generally arose from
distinct ideas, and a dawn of light
allowed him to see a great way farther
than common mortals.</p>

<p>He was now convinced that the orphan
was not very unfortunate in having
lost such a mother. The parent that
inspires fond affection without respect,
is seldom an useful one; and they only
are respectable, who consider right and
wrong abstracted from local forms and
accidental modifications.</p>

<p>Determined to adopt the child, he
named it after himself, Sagesta, and
retired to the hut where the innocent
slept, to think of the best method of
educating this child, whom the angry
deep had spared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-126" id="Pg_4-126"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-126.png">126</a>]</span>
[The last branch of the education of
Sagesta, consisted of a variety of characters
and stories presented to her
in the Cave of Fancy, of which the
following is a specimen.]</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-127" id="Pg_4-127"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-127.png">127</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAP" id="CHAP"></a>CHAP.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A form</span> now approached that
particularly struck and interested Sagesta.
The sage, observing what passed in her
mind, bade her ever trust to the first
impression. In life, he continued, try
to remember the effect the first appearance
of a stranger has on your mind;
and, in proportion to your sensibility,
you may decide on the character. Intelligence
glances from eyes that have
the same pursuits, and a benevolent
heart soon traces the marks of benevolence
on the countenance of an unknown
fellow-creature; and not only
the countenance, but the gestures, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-128" id="Pg_4-128"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-128.png">128</a>]</span>
voice, loudly speak truth to the unprejudiced
mind.</p>

<p>Whenever a stranger advances towards
you with a tripping step, receives
you with broad smiles, and a profusion
of compliments, and yet you find yourself
embarrassed and unable to return
the salutation with equal cordiality, be
assured that such a person is affected,
and endeavours to maintain a very good
character in the eyes of the world,
without really practising the social virtues
which dress the face in looks of
unfeigned complacency. Kindred minds
are drawn to each other by expressions
which elude description; and, like the
calm breeze that plays on a smooth
lake, they are rather felt than seen.
Beware of a man who always appears in
good humour; a selfish design too frequently
lurks in the smiles the heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-129" id="Pg_4-129"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-129.png">129</a>]</span>
never curved; or there is an affectation
of candour that destroys all strength of
character, by blending truth and falshood
into an unmeaning mass. The
mouth, in fact, seems to be the feature
where you may trace every kind of dissimulation,
from the simper of vanity,
to the fixed smile of the designing villain.
Perhaps, the modulations of
the voice will still more quickly give
a key to the character than even the
turns of the mouth, or the words
that issue from it; often do the
tones of unpractised dissemblers give
the lie to their assertions. Many
people never speak in an unnatural
voice, but when they are insincere: the
phrases not corresponding with the
dictates of the heart, have nothing to
keep them in tune. In the course of
an argument however, you may easily
discover whether vanity or conviction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-130" id="Pg_4-130"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-130.png">130</a>]</span>
stimulates the disputant, though his
inflated countenance may be turned
from you, and you may not see the
gestures which mark self-sufficiency.
He stopped, and the spirit began.</p>

<p>I have wandered through the cave;
and, as soon as I have taught you a useful
lesson, I shall take my flight where
my tears will cease to flow, and where
mine eyes will no more be shocked
with the sight of guilt and sorrow.
Before many moons have changed,
thou wilt enter, O mortal! into that
world I have lately left. Listen to my
warning voice, and trust not too much
to the goodness which I perceive resides
in thy breast. Let it be reined in by
principles, lest thy very virtue sharpen
the sting of remorse, which as naturally
follows disorder in the moral world, as
pain attends on intemperance in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-131" id="Pg_4-131"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-131.png">131</a>]</span>
physical. But my history will afford you
more instruction than mere advice. Sagestus
concurred in opinion with her,
observing that the senses of children
should be the first object of improvement;
then their passions worked on; and judgment
the fruit, must be the acquirement
of the being itself, when out of
leading-strings. The spirit bowed assent,
and, without any further prelude,
entered on her history.</p>

<p>My mother was a most respectable
character, but she was yoked to a man
whose follies and vices made her ever
feel the weight of her chains. The
first sensation I recollect, was pity; for
I have seen her weep over me and the
rest of her babes, lamenting that the
extravagance of a father would throw
us destitute on the world. But, though
my father was extravagant, and seldom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-132" id="Pg_4-132"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-132.png">132</a>]</span>
thought of any thing but his own pleasures,
our education was not neglected.
In solitude, this employment was my
mother's only solace; and my father's
pride made him procure us masters;
nay, sometimes he was so gratified by
our improvement, that he would embrace
us with tenderness, and intreat
my mother to forgive him, with marks
of real contrition. But the affection his
penitence gave rise to, only served to
expose her to continual disappointments,
and keep hope alive merely to
torment her. After a violent debauch
he would let his beard grow, and the
sadness that reigned in the house I shall
never forget; he was ashamed to meet
even the eyes of his children. This is so
contrary to the nature of things, it
gave me exquisite pain; I used, at those
times, to show him extreme respect. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-133" id="Pg_4-133"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-133.png">133</a>]</span>
could not bear to see my parent humble
himself before me. However neither
his constitution, nor fortune could
long bear the constant waste. He had,
I have observed, a childish affection
for his children, which was displayed
in caresses that gratified him for the
moment, yet never restrained the headlong
fury of his appetites; his momentary
repentance wrung his heart, without
influencing his conduct; and he died,
leaving an encumbered wreck of a good
estate.</p>

<p>As we had always lived in splendid
poverty, rather than in affluence, the
shock was not so great; and my mother
repressed her anguish, and concealed
some circumstances, that she might not
shed a destructive mildew over the
gaiety of youth.</p>

<p>So fondly did I doat on this dear pa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-134" id="Pg_4-134"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-134.png">134</a>]</span>rent,
that she engrossed all my tenderness;
her sorrows had knit me firmly to
her, and my chief care was to give her
proofs of affection. The gallantry that
afforded my companions, the few young
people my mother forced me to mix
with, so much pleasure, I despised; I
wished more to be loved than admired,
for I could love. I adored virtue; and
my imagination, chasing a chimerical
object, overlooked the common pleasures
of life; they were not sufficient for my
happiness. A latent fire made me burn
to rise superior to my contemporaries in
wisdom and virtue; and tears of joy
and emulation filled my eyes when I
read an account of a great action&mdash;I
felt admiration, not astonishment.</p>

<p>My mother had two particular friends,
who endeavoured to settle her affairs;
one was a middle-aged man, a mer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-135" id="Pg_4-135"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-135.png">135</a>]</span>chant;
the human breast never enshrined
a more benevolent heart. His
manners were rather rough, and he
bluntly spoke his thoughts without observing
the pain it gave; yet he possessed
extreme tenderness, as far as his discernment
went. Men do not make
sufficient distinction, said she, digressing
from her story to address Sagestus, between
tenderness and sensibility.</p>

<p>To give the shortest definition of sensibility,
replied the sage, I should say
that it is the result of acute senses, finely
fashioned nerves, which vibrate at the
slightest touch, and convey such clear intelligence
to the brain, that it does not
require to be arranged by the judgment.
Such persons instantly enter into the
characters of others, and instinctively
discern what will give pain to every
human being; their own feelings are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-136" id="Pg_4-136"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-136.png">136</a>]</span>
so varied that they seem to contain in
themselves, not only all the passions of the
species, but their various modifications.
Exquisite pain and pleasure is their
portion; nature wears for them a different
aspect than is displayed to common
mortals. One moment it is a paradise;
all is beautiful: a cloud arises, an emotion
receives a sudden damp; darkness
invades the sky, and the world is an
unweeded garden;&mdash;but go on with
your narrative, said Sagestus, recollecting
himself.</p>

<p>She proceeded. The man I am describing
was humanity itself; but frequently
he did not understand me; many of my
feelings were not to be analyzed by
his common sense. His friendships,
for he had many friends, gave him pleasure
unmixed with pain; his religion
was coldly reasonable, because he want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-137" id="Pg_4-137"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-137.png">137</a>]</span>ed
fancy, and he did not feel the necessity
of finding, or creating, a perfect
object, to answer the one engraved on
his heart: the sketch there was faint.
He went with the stream, and rather
caught a character from the society he
lived in, than spread one around him.
In my mind many opinions were graven
with a pen of brass, which he thought
chimerical: but time could not erase
them, and I now recognize them as
the seeds of eternal happiness: they
will soon expand in those realms where
I shall enjoy the bliss adapted to my
nature; this is all we need ask of the
Supreme Being; happiness must follow
the completion of his designs. He
however could live quietly, without
giving a preponderancy to many important
opinions that continually obtruded
on my mind; not having an en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-138" id="Pg_4-138"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-138.png">138</a>]</span>thusiastic
affection for his fellow creatures,
he did them good, without suffering
from their follies. He was particularly
attached to me, and I felt for
him all the affection of a daughter;
often, when he had been interesting
himself to promote my welfare, have I
lamented that he was not my father;
lamented that the vices of mine had
dried up one source of pure affection.</p>

<p>The other friend I have already alluded
to, was of a very different character;
greatness of mind, and those
combinations of feeling which are so
difficult to describe, raised him above
the throng, that bustle their hour out,
lie down to sleep, and are forgotten.
But I shall soon see him, she exclaimed,
as much superior to his former self, as
he then rose in my eyes above his fellow
creatures! As she spoke, a glow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-139" id="Pg_4-139"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-139.png">139</a>]</span>
of delight animated each feature; her
countenance appeared transparent; and
she silently anticipated the happiness
she should enjoy, when she entered those
mansions, where death-divided friends
should meet, to part no more; where
human weakness could not damp their
bliss, or poison the cup of joy that, on
earth, drops from the lips as soon as
tasted, or, if some daring mortal snatches
a hasty draught, what was sweet to the
taste becomes a root of bitterness.</p>

<p>He was unfortunate, had many cares
to struggle with, and I marked on his
cheeks traces of the same sorrows that
sunk my own. He was unhappy I say,
and perhaps pity might first have awoke
my tenderness; for, early in life, an
artful woman worked on his compassionate
soul, and he united his fate to
a being made up of such jarring ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-140" id="Pg_4-140"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-140.png">140</a>]</span>ments,
that he was still alone. The
discovery did not extinguish that propensity
to love, a high sense of virtue
fed. I saw him sick and unhappy,
without a friend to sooth the hours
languor made heavy; often did I sit a
long winter's evening by his side, railing
at the swift wings of time, and
terming my love, humanity.</p>

<p>Two years passed in this manner, silently
rooting my affection; and it might
have continued calm, if a fever had
not brought him to the very verge of
the grave. Though still deceived, I was
miserable that the customs of the world
did not allow me to watch by him;
when sleep forsook his pillow, my wearied
eyes were not closed, and my
anxious spirit hovered round his bed.
I saw him, before he had recovered his
strength; and, when his hand touched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-141" id="Pg_4-141"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-141.png">141</a>]</span>
mine, life almost retired, or flew to
meet the touch. The first look found
a ready way to my heart, and thrilled
through every vein. We were left
alone, and insensibly began to talk of
the immortality of the soul; I declared
that I could not live without this conviction.
In the ardour of conversation
he pressed my hand to his heart; it
rested there a moment, and my emotions
gave weight to my opinion, for
the affection we felt was not of a perishable
nature.&mdash;A silence ensued, I
know not how long; he then threw
my hand from him, as if it had been a
serpent; formally complained of the
weather, and adverted to twenty other
uninteresting subjects. Vain efforts!
Our hearts had already spoken to
each other.</p>

<p>Feebly did I afterwards combat an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-142" id="Pg_4-142"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-142.png">142</a>]</span>
affection, which seemed twisted in every
fibre of my heart. The world stood still
when I thought of him; it moved heavily
at best, with one whose very constitution
seemed to mark her out for misery.
But I will not dwell on the passion
I too fondly nursed. One only refuge
had I on earth; I could not resolutely
desolate the scene my fancy flew to,
when worldly cares, when a knowledge
of mankind, which my circumstances
forced on me, rendered every other
insipid. I was afraid of the unmarked
vacuity of common life; yet, though I
supinely indulged myself in fairy-land,
when I ought to have been more actively
employed, virtue was still the
first mover of my actions; she dressed
my love in such enchanting colours,
and spread the net I could never break.
Our corresponding feelings confounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-143" id="Pg_4-143"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-143.png">143</a>]</span>
our very souls; and in many conversations
we almost intuitively discerned
each other's sentiments; the heart opened
itself, not chilled by reserve, nor
afraid of misconstruction. But, if virtue
inspired love, love gave new energy to
virtue, and absorbed every selfish passion.
Never did even a wish escape
me, that my lover should not fulfil the
hard duties which fate had imposed on
him. I only dissembled with him in
one particular; I endeavoured to soften
his wife's too conspicuous follies, and
extenuated her failings in an indirect
manner. To this I was prompted by a
loftiness of spirit; I should have broken
the band of life, had I ceased to respect
myself. But I will hasten to an important
change in my circumstances.</p>

<p>My mother, who had concealed the
real state of her affairs from me, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-144" id="Pg_4-144"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-144.png">144</a>]</span>
now impelled to make me her confident,
that I might assist to discharge
her mighty debt of gratitude. The
merchant, my more than father, had
privately assisted her: but a fatal civil-war
reduced his large property to a
bare competency; and an inflammation
in his eyes, that arose from a cold he
had caught at a wreck, which he watched
during a stormy night to keep off
the lawless colliers, almost deprived
him of sight. His life had been spent
in society, and he scarcely knew how
to fill the void; for his spirit would not
allow him to mix with his former
equals as an humble companion; he
who had been treated with uncommon
respect, could not brook their insulting
pity. From the resource of solitude,
reading, the complaint in his eyes cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-145" id="Pg_4-145"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-145.png">145</a>]</span>
him off, and he became our constant
visitor.</p>

<p>Actuated by the sincerest affection,
I used to read to him, and he mistook
my tenderness for love. How could I
undeceive him, when every circumstance
frowned on him! Too soon I
found that I was his only comfort; I,
who rejected his hand when fortune
smiled, could not now second her blow;
and, in a moment of enthusiastic gratitude
and tender compassion, I offered
him my hand.&mdash;It was received with
pleasure; transport was not made for
his soul; nor did he discover that nature
had separated us, by making me
alive to such different sensations. My
mother was to live with us, and I
dwelt on this circumstance to banish
cruel recollections, when the bent bow
returned to its former state.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-146" id="Pg_4-146"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-146.png">146</a>]</span>
With a bursting heart and a firm
voice, I named the day when I was to
seal my promise. It came, in spite of
my regret; I had been previously preparing
myself for the awful ceremony,
and answered the solemn question with
a resolute tone, that would silence the
dictates of my heart; it was a forced,
unvaried one; had nature modulated
it, my secret would have escaped. My
active spirit was painfully on the watch
to repress every tender emotion. The
joy in my venerable parent's countenance,
the tenderness of my husband,
as he conducted me home, for I really
had a sincere affection for him, the gratulations
of my mind, when I thought
that this sacrifice was heroic, all tended
to deceive me; but the joy of victory
over the resigned, pallid look of my
lover, haunted my imagination, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-147" id="Pg_4-147"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-147.png">147</a>]</span>
fixed itself in the centre of my brain.&mdash;Still
I imagined, that his spirit was near
me, that he only felt sorrow for my
loss, and without complaint resigned
me to my duty.</p>

<p>I was left alone a moment; my two
elbows rested on a table to support my
chin. Ten thousand thoughts darted
with astonishing velocity through my
mind. My eyes were dry; I was on the
brink of madness. At this moment a
strange association was made by my
imagination; I thought of Gallileo, who
when he left the inquisition, looked
upwards, and cried out, "Yet it moves."
A shower of tears, like the refreshing
drops of heaven, relieved my parched
sockets; they fell disregarded on the
table; and, stamping with my foot, in an
agony I exclaimed, "Yet I love." My
husband entered before I had calmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-148" id="Pg_4-148"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-148.png">148</a>]</span>
these tumultuous emotions, and tenderly
took my hand. I snatched it from
him; grief and surprise were marked
on his countenance; I hastily stretched
it out again. My heart smote me, and I
removed the transient mist by an unfeigned
endeavour to please him.</p>

<p>A few months after, my mind grew
calmer; and, if a treacherous imagination,
if feelings many accidents revived,
sometimes plunged me into melancholy,
I often repeated with steady
conviction, that virtue was not an
empty name, and that, in following the
dictates of duty, I had not bidden adieu
to content.</p>

<p>In the course of a few years, the
dear object of my fondest affection,
said farewel, in dying accents. Thus
left alone, my grief became dear; and I
did not feel solitary, because I thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-149" id="Pg_4-149"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-149.png">149</a>]</span>
I might, without a crime, indulge a
passion, that grew more ardent than ever
when my imagination only presented
him to my view, and restored my former
activity of soul which the late
calm had rendered torpid. I seemed to
find myself again, to find the eccentric
warmth that gave me identity of character.
Reason had governed my conduct,
but could not change my nature;
this voluptuous sorrow was superior to
every gratification of sense, and death
more firmly united our hearts.</p>

<p>Alive to every human affection, I
smoothed my mothers passage to eternity,
and so often gave my husband
sincere proofs of affection, he never
supposed that I was actuated by a more
fervent attachment. My melancholy,
my uneven spirits, he attributed to my
extreme sensibility, and loved me the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-150" id="Pg_4-150"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-150.png">150</a>]</span>
better for possessing qualities he could
not comprehend.</p>

<p>At the close of a summer's day, some
years after, I wandered with careless
steps over a pathless common; various
anxieties had rendered the hours which
the sun had enlightened heavy; sober
evening came on; I wished to still "my
mind, and woo lone quiet in her silent
walk." The scene accorded with my
feelings; it was wild and grand; and
the spreading twilight had almost confounded
the distant sea with the barren,
blue hills that melted from my sight.
I sat down on a rising ground; the rays
of the departing sun illumined the horizon,
but so indistinctly, that I anticipated
their total extinction. The
death of Nature led me to a still more
interesting subject, that came home to
my bosom, the death of him I loved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-151" id="Pg_4-151"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-151.png">151</a>]</span>
A village-bell was tolling; I listened,
and thought of the moment when I
heard his interrupted breath, and felt
the agonizing fear, that the same sound
would never more reach my ears, and
that the intelligence glanced from my
eyes, would no more be felt. The
spoiler had seized his prey; the sun
was fled, what was this world to me!
I wandered to another, where death
and darkness could not enter; I pursued
the sun beyond the mountains,
and the soul escaped from this vale of
tears. My reflections were tinged with
melancholy, but they were sublime.&mdash;I
grasped a mighty whole, and smiled
on the king of terrors; the tie which
bound me to my friends he could not
break; the same mysterious knot united
me to the source of all goodness and
happiness. I had seen the divinity re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-152" id="Pg_4-152"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-152.png">152</a>]</span>flected
in a face I loved; I had read
immortal characters displayed on a
human countenance, and forgot myself
whilst I gazed. I could not think of
immortality, without recollecting the
ecstacy I felt, when my heart first whispered
to me that I was beloved; and
again did I feel the sacred tie of mutual
affection; fervently I prayed to the father
of mercies; and rejoiced that he
could see every turn of a heart, whose
movements I could not perfectly understand.
My passion seemed a pledge
of immortality; I did not wish to hide
it from the all-searching eye of heaven.
Where indeed could I go from his presence?
and, whilst it was dear to me,
though darkness might reign during
the night of life, joy would come when
I awoke to life everlasting.</p>

<p>I now turned my step towards home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-153" id="Pg_4-153"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-153.png">153</a>]</span>
when the appearance of a girl, who
stood weeping on the common, attracted
my attention. I accosted her,
and soon heard her simple tale; that her
father was gone to sea, and her mother
sick in bed. I followed her to their
little dwelling, and relieved the sick
wretch. I then again sought my own
abode; but death did not now haunt
my fancy. Contriving to give the poor
creature I had left more effectual relief,
I reached my own garden-gate very
weary, and rested on it.&mdash;Recollecting
the turns of my mind during the walk,
I exclaimed, Surely life may thus be
enlivened by active benevolence, and
the sleep of death, like that I am now
disposed to fall into, may be sweet!</p>

<p>My life was now unmarked by any
extraordinary change, and a few days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-154" id="Pg_4-154"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-154.png">154</a>]</span>
ago I entered this cavern; for through
it every mortal must pass; and here I
have discovered, that I neglected many
opportunities of being useful, whilst I
fostered a devouring flame. Remorse
has not reached me, because I firmly
adhered to my principles, and I have
also discovered that I saw through a
false medium. Worthy as the mortal
was I adored, I should not long have
loved him with the ardour I did, had
fate united us, and broken the delusion
the imagination so artfully wove. His
virtues, as they now do, would have
extorted my esteem; but he who formed
the human soul, only can fill it, and the
chief happiness of an immortal being
must arise from the same source as its
existence. Earthly love leads to heavenly,
and prepares us for a more ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-155" id="Pg_4-155"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-155.png">155</a>]</span>alted
state; if it does not change its
nature, and destroy itself, by trampling
on the virtue, that constitutes its essence,
and allies us to the Deity.</p>

<h3>ON</h3>

<h2>POETRY, &amp;c.</h2>
<hr class="short" />
<p><span class="smcap">A taste</span> for rural scenes, in the
present state of society, appears to be
very often an artificial sentiment, rather
inspired by poetry and romances,
than a real perception of the beauties
of nature. But, as it is reckoned a
proof of refined taste to praise the calm
pleasures which the country affords, the
theme is never exhausted. Yet it may
be made a question, whether this ro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-160" id="Pg_4-160"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-160.png">160</a>]</span>mantic
kind of declamation, has much
effect on the conduct of those, who
leave, for a season, the crowded cities
in which they were bred.</p>

<p>I have been led to these reflections,
by observing, when I have resided for
any length of time in the country, how
few people seem to contemplate nature
with their own eyes. I have "brushed
the dew away" in the morning; but,
pacing over the printless grass, I have
wondered that, in such delightful situations,
the sun was allowed to rise in
solitary majesty, whilst my eyes alone
hailed its beautifying beams. The
webs of the evening have still been
spread across the hedged path, unless
some labouring man, trudging to work,
disturbed the fairy structure; yet, in
spite of this supineness, when I joined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-161" id="Pg_4-161"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-161.png">161</a>]</span>
the social circle, every tongue rang
changes on the pleasures of the country.</p>

<p>Having frequently had occasion to
make the same observation, I was led to
endeavour, in one of my solitary rambles,
to trace the cause, and likewise
to enquire why the poetry written in
the infancy of society, is most natural:
which, strictly speaking (for <i>natural</i>
is a very indefinite expression) is merely
to say, that it is the transcript of immediate
sensations, in all their native
wildness and simplicity, when fancy,
awakened by the sight of interesting
objects, was most actively at work.
At such moments, sensibility quickly
furnishes similes, and the sublimated
spirits combine images, which rising
spontaneously, it is not necessary coldly
to ransack the understanding or memory,
till the laborious efforts of judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-162" id="Pg_4-162"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-162.png">162</a>]</span>ment
exclude present sensations, and
damp the fire of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The effusions of a vigorous mind, will
ever tell us how far the understanding
has been enlarged by thought, and
stored with knowledge. The richness
of the soil even appears on the surface;
and the result of profound thinking,
often mixing, with playful grace, in the
reveries of the poet, smoothly incorporates
with the ebullitions of animal
spirits, when the finely fashioned nerve
vibrates acutely with rapture, or when,
relaxed by soft melancholy, a pleasing
languor prompts the long-drawn sigh,
and feeds the slowly falling tear.</p>

<p>The poet, the man of strong feelings,
gives us only an image of his mind,
when he was actually alone, conversing
with himself, and marking the impression
which nature had made on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-163" id="Pg_4-163"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-163.png">163</a>]</span>
own heart.&mdash;If, at this sacred moment,
the idea of some departed friend, some
tender recollection when the soul was
most alive to tenderness, intruded unawares
into his thoughts, the sorrow
which it produced is artlessly, yet poetically
expressed&mdash;and who can avoid
sympathizing?</p>

<p>Love to man leads to devotion&mdash;grand
and sublime images strike the
imagination&mdash;God is seen in every
floating cloud, and comes from the
misty mountain to receive the noblest
homage of an intelligent creature&mdash;praise.
How solemn is the moment,
when all affections and remembrances
fade before the sublime admiration
which the wisdom and goodness of God
inspires, when he is worshipped in a
<i>temple not made with hands</i>, and the
world seems to contain only the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-164" id="Pg_4-164"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-164.png">164</a>]</span>
that formed, and the mind that contemplates
it! These are not the weak
responses of ceremonial devotion; nor,
to express them, would the poet need
another poet's aid: his heart burns
within him, and he speaks the language
of truth and nature with resistless
energy.</p>

<p>Inequalities, of course, are observable
in his effusions; and a less vigorous
fancy, with more taste, would
have produced more elegance and uniformity;
but, as passages are softened
or expunged during the cooler moments
of reflection, the understanding
is gratified at the expence of those involuntary
sensations, which, like the
beauteous tints of an evening sky, are
so evanescent, that they melt into new
forms before they can be analyzed. For
however eloquently we may boast of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-165" id="Pg_4-165"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-165.png">165</a>]</span>
our reason, man must often be delighted
he cannot tell why, or his blunt
feelings are not made to relish the beauties
which nature, poetry, or any of
the imitative arts, afford.</p>

<p>The imagery of the ancients seems
naturally to have been borrowed from
surrounding objects and their mythology.
When a hero is to be transported
from one place to another, across
pathless wastes, is any vehicle so natural,
as one of the fleecy clouds on which
the poet has often gazed, scarcely conscious
that he wished to make it his
chariot? Again, when nature seems
to present obstacles to his progress at
almost every step, when the tangled
forest and steep mountain stand as barriers,
to pass over which the mind
longs for supernatural aid; an interposing
deity, who walks on the waves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-166" id="Pg_4-166"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-166.png">166</a>]</span>
and rules the storm, severely felt in the
first attempts to cultivate a country,
will receive from the impassioned fancy
"a local habitation and a name."</p>

<p>It would be a philosophical enquiry,
and throw some light on the history of
the human mind, to trace, as far as our
information will allow us to trace, the
spontaneous feelings and ideas which
have produced the images that now
frequently appear unnatural, because
they are remote; and disgusting, because
they have been servilely copied
by poets, whose habits of thinking,
and views of nature must have been
different; for, though the understanding
seldom disturbs the current of our present
feelings, without dissipating the
gay clouds which fancy has been embracing,
yet it silently gives the colour
to the whole tenour of them, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-167" id="Pg_4-167"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-167.png">167</a>]</span>
dream is over, when truth is grossly
violated, or images introduced, selected
from books, and not from local manners
or popular prejudices.</p>

<p>In a more advanced state of civilization,
a poet is rather the creature of
art, than of nature. The books that he
reads in his youth, become a hot-bed
in which artificial fruits are produced,
beautiful to the common eye, though
they want the true hue and flavour.
His images do not arise from sensations;
they are copies; and, like the works
of the painters who copy ancient statues
when they draw men and women
of their own times, we acknowledge
that the features are fine, and the proportions
just; yet they are men of
stone; insipid figures, that never convey
to the mind the idea of a portrait
taken from life, where the soul gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-168" id="Pg_4-168"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-168.png">168</a>]</span>
spirit and homogeneity to the whole.
The silken wings of fancy are shrivelled
by rules; and a desire of attaining
elegance of diction, occasions an attention
to words, incompatible with
sublime, impassioned thoughts.</p>

<p>A boy of abilities, who has been
taught the structure of verse at school,
and been roused by emulation to compose
rhymes whilst he was reading
works of genius, may, by practice,
produce pretty verses, and even become
what is often termed an elegant
poet: yet his readers, without knowing
what to find fault with, do not
find themselves warmly interested. In
the works of the poets who fasten on
their affections, they see grosser faults,
and the very images which shock their
taste in the modern; still they do not appear
as puerile or extrinsic in one as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-169" id="Pg_4-169"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-169.png">169</a>]</span>
other.&mdash;Why?&mdash;because they did not
appear so to the author.</p>

<p>It may sound paradoxical, after observing
that those productions want
vigour, that are merely the work of
imitation, in which the understanding
has violently directed, if not extinguished,
the blaze of fancy, to assert, that,
though genius be only another word
for exquisite sensibility, the first observers
of nature, the true poets, exercised
their understanding much more
than their imitators. But they exercised
it to discriminate things, whilst
their followers were busy to borrow
sentiments and arrange words.</p>

<p>Boys who have received a classical
education, load their memory with
words, and the correspondent ideas
are perhaps never distinctly comprehended.
As a proof of this assertion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-170" id="Pg_4-170"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-170.png">170</a>]</span>
I must observe, that I have known
many young people who could write
tolerably smooth verses, and string epithets
prettily together, when their
prose themes showed the barrenness of
their minds, and how superficial the
cultivation must have been, which
their understanding had received.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, I know, has given a definition
of genius, which would overturn
my reasoning, if I were to admit
it.&mdash;He imagines, that <i>a strong mind,
accidentally led to some particular study</i> in
which it excels, is a genius.&mdash;Not to
stop to investigate the causes which
produced this happy <i>strength</i> of mind,
experience seems to prove, that those
minds have appeared most vigorous,
that have pursued a study, after nature
had discovered a bent; for it would be
absurd to suppose, that a slight impres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-171" id="Pg_4-171"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-171.png">171</a>]</span>sion
made on the weak faculties of a
boy, is the fiat of fate, and not to be
effaced by any succeeding impression,
or unexpected difficulty. Dr. Johnson
in fact, appears sometimes to be of the
same opinion (how consistently I shall
not now enquire), especially when he
observes, "that Thomson looked on
nature with the eye which she only
gives to a poet."</p>

<p>But, though it should be allowed
that books may produce some poets, I
fear they will never be the poets who
charm our cares to sleep, or extort admiration.
They may diffuse taste, and
polish the language; but I am inclined
to conclude that they will seldom rouse
the passions, or amend the heart.</p>

<p>And, to return to the first subject of
discussion, the reason why most people
are more interested by a scene describ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-172" id="Pg_4-172"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-172.png">172</a>]</span>ed
by a poet, than by a view of nature,
probably arises from the want of a
lively imagination. The poet contracts
the prospect, and, selecting the most
picturesque part in his <i>camera</i>, the judgment
is directed, and the whole force
of the languid faculty turned towards
the objects which excited the most
forcible emotions in the poet's heart;
the reader consequently feels the enlivened
description, though he was not
able to receive a first impression from
the operations of his own mind.</p>

<p>Besides, it may be further observed,
that gross minds are only to be moved
by forcible representations. To rouse
the thoughtless, objects must be presented,
calculated to produce tumultuous
emotions; the unsubstantial, picturesque
forms which a contemplative
man gazes on, and often follows with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-173" id="Pg_4-173"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-173.png">173</a>]</span>
ardour till he is mocked by a glimpse
of unattainable excellence, appear to
them the light vapours of a dreaming
enthusiast, who gives up the substance
for the shadow. It is not within that
they seek amusement; their eyes are
seldom turned on themselves; consequently
their emotions, though sometimes
fervid, are always transient, and
the nicer perceptions which distinguish
the man of genuine taste, are not felt,
or make such a slight impression as
scarcely to excite any pleasurable sensations.
Is it surprising then that they
are often overlooked, even by those
who are delighted by the same images
concentrated by the poet?</p>

<p>But even this numerous class is exceeded,
by witlings, who, anxious
to appear to have wit and taste, do
not allow their understandings or feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-174" id="Pg_4-174"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-174.png">174</a>]</span>ings
any liberty; for, instead of cultivating
their faculties and reflecting on
their operations, they are busy collecting
prejudices; and are predetermined
to admire what the suffrage of time
announces as excellent, not to store up
a fund of amusement for themselves,
but to enable them to talk.</p>

<p>These hints will assist the reader to
trace some of the causes why the beauties
of nature are not forcibly felt,
when civilization, or rather luxury,
has made considerable advances&mdash;those
calm sensations are not sufficiently
lively to serve as a relaxation to the voluptuary,
or even to the moderate pursuer
of artificial pleasures. In the present
state of society, the understanding
must bring back the feelings to nature,
or the sensibility must have such native
strength, as rather to be whetted than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-175" id="Pg_4-175"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-175.png">175</a>]</span>
destroyed by the strong exercises of
passion.</p>

<p>That the most valuable things are liable
to the greatest perversion, is however
as trite as true:&mdash;for the same sensibility,
or quickness of senses, which
makes a man relish the tranquil scenes
of nature, when sensation, rather than
reason, imparts delight, frequently makes
a libertine of him, by leading him to
prefer the sensual tumult of love a
little refined by sentiment, to the calm
pleasures of affectionate friendship, in
whose sober satisfactions, reason, mixing
her tranquillizing convictions, whispers,
that content, not happiness, is the
reward of virtue in this world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indolence</span> is the source of nervous
complaints, and a whole host of
cares. This devil might say that his
name was legion.</p>

<p class="center">2.</p>
<p>It should be one of the employments
of women of fortune, to visit hospitals,
and superintend the conduct of inferiors.</p>

<p class="center">3.</p>
<p>It is generally supposed, that the
imagination of women is particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-180" id="Pg_4-180"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-180.png">180</a>]</span>
active, and leads them astray. Why
then do we seek by education only to
exercise their imagination and feeling,
till the understanding, grown rigid by
disuse, is unable to exercise itself&mdash;and
the superfluous nourishment the
imagination and feeling have received,
renders the former romantic, and the
latter weak?</p>

<p class="center">4.</p>
<p>Few men have risen to any great
eminence in learning, who have not
received something like a regular education.
Why are women expected to
surmount difficulties that men are not
equal to?</p>

<p class="center">5.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more absurd than
the ridicule of the critic, that the heroine
of his mock-tragedy was in love
with the very man whom she ought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-181" id="Pg_4-181"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-181.png">181</a>]</span>
least to have loved; he could not have
given a better reason. How can passion
gain strength any other way? In Otaheite,
love cannot be known, where
the obstacles to irritate an indiscriminate
appetite, and sublimate the simple
sensations of desire till they mount to
passion, are never known. There a
man or woman cannot love the very
person they ought not to have loved&mdash;nor
does jealousy ever fan the flame.</p>

<p class="center">6.</p>
<p>It has frequently been observed, that,
when women have an object in view,
they pursue it with more steadiness than
men, particularly love. This is not
a compliment. Passion pursues with
more heat than reason, and with most
ardour during the absence of reason.</p>

<p class="center">7.</p>
<p>Men are more subject to the physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-182" id="Pg_4-182"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-182.png">182</a>]</span>
love than women. The confined education
of women makes them more
subject to jealousy.</p>

<p class="center">8.</p>
<p>Simplicity seems, in general, the consequence
of ignorance, as I have observed
in the characters of women and
sailors&mdash;the being confined to one track
of impressions.</p>

<p class="center">9.</p>
<p>I know of no other way of preserving
the chastity of mankind, than that
of rendering women rather objects of
love than desire. The difference is
great. Yet, while women are encouraged
to ornament their persons at the
expence of their minds, while indolence
renders them helpless and lascivious
(for what other name can be
given to the common intercourse between
the sexes?) they will be, gene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-183" id="Pg_4-183"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-183.png">183</a>]</span>rally
speaking, only objects of desire;
and, to such women, men cannot be
constant. Men, accustomed only to
have their senses moved, merely seek
for a selfish gratification in the society
of women, and their sexual instinct,
being neither supported by the understanding
nor the heart, must be excited
by variety.</p>

<p class="center">10.</p>
<p>We ought to respect old opinions;
though prejudices, blindly adopted,
lead to error, and preclude all exercise
of the reason.</p>

<p>The emulation which often makes a
boy mischievous, is a generous spur;
and the old remark, that unlucky, turbulent
boys, make the wisest and best
men, is true, spite of Mr. Knox's arguments.
It has been observed, that the
most adventurous horses, when tamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-184" id="Pg_4-184"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-184.png">184</a>]</span>
or domesticated, are the most mild and
tractable.</p>

<p class="center">11.</p>
<p>The children who start up suddenly
at twelve or fourteen, and fall into decays,
in consequence, as it is termed,
of outgrowing their strength, are in
general, I believe, those children, who
have been bred up with mistaken tenderness,
and not allowed to sport and
take exercise in the open air. This is
analogous to plants: for it is found that
they run up sickly, long stalks, when
confined.</p>

<p class="center">12.</p>
<p>Children should be taught to feel deference,
not to practise submission.</p>

<p class="center">13.</p>
<p>It is always a proof of false refinement,
when a fastidious taste overpowers
sympathy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-185" id="Pg_4-185"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-185.png">185</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">14.</p>
<p>Lust appears to be the most natural
companion of wild ambition; and love
of human praise, of that dominion
erected by cunning.</p>

<p class="center">15.</p>
<p>"Genius decays as judgment increases."
Of course, those who have
the least genius, have the earliest appearance
of wisdom.</p>

<p class="center">16.</p>
<p>A knowledge of the fine arts, is seldom
subservient to the promotion of
either religion or virtue. Elegance is
often indecency; witness our prints.</p>

<p class="center">17.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any evil
in the world, but what is necessary.
The doctrine of rewards and punishments,
not considered as a means of re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-186" id="Pg_4-186"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-186.png">186</a>]</span>formation,
appears to me an infamous
libel on divine goodness.</p>

<p class="center">18.</p>
<p>Whether virtue is founded on reason
or revelation, virtue is wisdom, and
vice is folly. Why are positive punishments?</p>

<p class="center">19.</p>
<p>Few can walk alone. The staff of
Christianity is the necessary support of
human weakness. But an acquaintance
with the nature of man and virtue,
with just sentiments on the attributes,
would be sufficient, without a voice
from heaven, to lead some to virtue,
but not the mob.</p>

<p class="center">20.</p>
<p>I only expect the natural reward of
virtue, whatever it may be. I rely not
on a positive reward.</p>

<p>The justice of God can be vindicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-187" id="Pg_4-187"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-187.png">187</a>]</span>
by a belief in a future state&mdash;but a continuation
of being vindicates it as
clearly, as the positive system of rewards
and punishments&mdash;by evil educing
good for the individual, and not
for an imaginary whole. The happiness
of the whole must arise from the
happiness of the constituent parts, or
this world is not a state of trial, but a
school.</p>

<p class="center">21.</p>
<p>The vices acquired by Augustus to
retain his power, must have tainted his
soul, and prevented that increase of
happiness a good man expects in the
next stage of existence. This was a
natural punishment.</p>

<p class="center">22.</p>
<p>The lover is ever most deeply enamoured,
when it is with he knows
not what&mdash;and the devotion of a mystic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-188" id="Pg_4-188"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-188.png">188</a>]</span>
has a rude Gothic grandeur in it, which
the respectful adoration of a philosopher
will never reach. I may be
thought fanciful; but it has continually
occurred to me, that, though, I allow,
reason in this world is the mother
of wisdom&mdash;yet some flights of the imagination
seem to reach what wisdom
cannot teach&mdash;and, while they delude
us here, afford a glorious hope, if not
a foretaste, of what we may expect
hereafter. He that created us, did not
mean to mark us with ideal images of
grandeur, the <i>baseless fabric of a vision</i>&mdash;No&mdash;that
perfection we follow with
hopeless ardour when the whisperings
of reason are heard, may be found,
when not incompatible with our state,
in the round of eternity. Perfection
indeed must, even then, be a comparative
idea&mdash;but the wisdom, the hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-189" id="Pg_4-189"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-189.png">189</a>]</span>piness
of a superior state, has been supposed
to be intuitive, and the happiest
effusions of human genius have seemed
like inspiration&mdash;the deductions of reason
destroy sublimity.</p>

<p class="center">23.</p>
<p>I am more and more convinced, that
poetry is the first effervescence of the
imagination, and the forerunner of civilization.</p>

<p class="center">24.</p>
<p>When the Arabs had no trace of literature
or science, they composed
beautiful verses on the subjects of love
and war. The flights of the imagination,
and the laboured deductions of
reason, appear almost incompatible.</p>

<p class="center">25.</p>
<p>Poetry certainly flourishes most in
the first rude state of society. The
passions speak most eloquently, when
they are not shackled by reason. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-190" id="Pg_4-190"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-190.png">190</a>]</span>
sublime expression, which has been so
often quoted, [Genesis, ch. 1, ver. 3.]
is perhaps a barbarous flight; or rather
the grand conception of an uncultivated
mind; for it is contrary to nature
and experience, to suppose that this
account is founded on facts&mdash;It is
doubtless a sublime allegory. But a
cultivated mind would not thus have
described the creation&mdash;for, arguing
from analogy, it appears that creation
must have been a comprehensive plan,
and that the Supreme Being always
uses second causes, slowly and silently
to fulfil his purpose. This is, in reality,
a more sublime view of that power
which wisdom supports: but it is not
the sublimity that would strike the impassioned
mind, in which the imagination
took place of intellect. Tell a
being, whose affections and passions
have been more exercised than his rea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-191" id="Pg_4-191"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-191.png">191</a>]</span>son,
that God said, <i>Let there be light!
and there was light</i>; and he would prostrate
himself before the Being who
could thus call things out of nothing,
as if they were: but a man in whom
reason had taken place of passion,
would not adore, till wisdom was conspicuous
as well as power, for his admiration
must be founded on principle.</p>

<p class="center">26.</p>
<p>Individuality is ever conspicuous in
those enthusiastic flights of fancy, in
which reason is left behind, without
being lost sight of.</p>

<p class="center">27.</p>
<p>The mind has been too often brought
to the test of enquiries which only
reach to matter&mdash;put into the crucible,
though the magnetic and electric fluid
escapes from the experimental philosopher.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-192" id="Pg_4-192"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-192.png">192</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">28.</p>
<p>Mr. Kant has observed, that the understanding
is sublime, the imagination
beautiful&mdash;yet it is evident, that poets,
and men who undoubtedly possess the
liveliest imagination, are most touched
by the sublime, while men who have
cold, enquiring minds, have not this
exquisite feeling in any great degree,
and indeed seem to lose it as they cultivate
their reason.</p>

<p class="center">29.</p>
<p>The Grecian buildings are graceful&mdash;they
fill the mind with all those pleasing
emotions, which elegance and beauty
never fail to excite in a cultivated
mind&mdash;utility and grace strike us in
unison&mdash;the mind is satisfied&mdash;things
appear just what they ought to be: a
calm satisfaction is felt, but the imagination
has nothing to do&mdash;no obscurity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-193" id="Pg_4-193"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-193.png">193</a>]</span>
darkens the gloom&mdash;like reasonable
content, we can say why we are pleased&mdash;and
this kind of pleasure may be
lasting, but it is never great.</p>

<p class="center">30.</p>
<p>When we say that a person is an
original, it is only to say in other words
that he thinks. "The less a man has
cultivated his rational faculties, the
more powerful is the principle of
imitation, over his actions, and his
habits of thinking. Most women,
of course, are more influenced by
the behaviour, the fashions, and the
opinions of those with whom they
associate, than men." (Smellie.)</p>

<p>When we read a book which supports
our favourite opinions, how eagerly
do we suck in the doctrines, and
suffer our minds placidly to reflect the
images which illustrate the tenets we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-194" id="Pg_4-194"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-194.png">194</a>]</span>
have embraced? We indolently or
quietly acquiesce in the conclusion, and
our spirit animates and connects the
various subjects. But, on the contrary,
when we peruse a skilful writer,
who does not coincide in opinion with
us, how is the mind on the watch to
detect fallacy? And this coolness often
prevents our being carried away by a
stream of eloquence, which the prejudiced
mind terms declamation&mdash;a pomp
of words.&mdash;We never allow ourselves to
be warmed; and, after contending
with the writer, are more confirmed
in our own opinion, as much perhaps
from a spirit of contradiction as from
reason.&mdash;Such is the strength of man!</p>

<p class="center">31.</p>
<p>It is the individual manner of seeing
and feeling, pourtrayed by a strong
imagination in bold images that have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-195" id="Pg_4-195"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-195.png">195</a>]</span>
struck the senses, which creates all the
charms of poetry. A great reader is
always quoting the description of another's
emotions; a strong imagination
delights to paint its own. A writer of
genius makes us feel; an inferior author
reason.</p>

<p class="center">32.</p>
<p>Some principle prior to self-love must
have existed: the feeling which produced
the pleasure, must have existed
before the experience.</p>

<h4>LETTER LXVIII</h4>

<p class="right">Sunday, October 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I wrote</span> to you by the packet, to
inform you, that your letter of the 18th
of la&#383;t month, had determined me to
&#383;et out with captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; but, as
we &#383;ailed very quick, I take it for

You &#383;ay, I mu&#383;t decide for my&#383;elf.&mdash;I
had decided, that it was mo&#383;t for the
intere&#383;t of my little girl, and for my
own comfort, little as I expect, for us
to live together; and I even thought
that you would be glad, &#383;ome years
hence, when the tumult of bu&#383;ine&#383;s was
over, to repo&#383;e in the &#383;ociety of an affectionate
friend, and mark the progre&#383;s
of our intere&#383;ting child, whil&#383;t endeavouring
to be of u&#383;e in the circle you

run about for ever.</p>

<p>From the tenour of your la&#383;t letter

have formed &#383;ome new attachment.&mdash;If
it be &#383;o, let me earne&#383;tly reque&#383;t you

This is the only proof I require of the

<p>I am labouring to write with calmne&#383;s&mdash;but
the extreme angui&#383;h I feel,
at landing without having any friend
to receive me, and even to be con&#383;cious
that the friend whom I mo&#383;t wi&#383;h
to &#383;ee, will feel a di&#383;agreeable &#383;en&#383;ation
at being informed of my arrival, does
not come under the de&#383;cription of common
mi&#383;ery. Every emotion yields to
an overwhelming flood of &#383;orrow&mdash;and
the playfulne&#383;s of my child di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es

ties which bind you to me and my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-9_S" id="Pg_4-9_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-9.png">9</a>]</span>
child.&mdash;Tell me, that you wi&#383;h it, and
I will cut this Gordian knot.</p>

<p>I now mo&#383;t earne&#383;tly intreat you to
write to me, without fail, by the return
of the po&#383;t. Direct your letter to
be left at the po&#383;t-office, and tell me
whether you will come to me here, or
where you will meet me. I can receive
your letter on Wedne&#383;day morning.</p>

<p>Do not keep me in &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e.&mdash;I expect
nothing from you, or any human
being: my die is ca&#383;t!&mdash;I have fortitude
enough to determine to do my
duty; yet I cannot rai&#383;e my depre&#383;&#383;ed
&#383;pirits, or calm my trembling heart.&mdash;That
being who moulded it thus,
knows that I am unable to tear up by

which has been the torment of my life&mdash;but

your under&#383;tanding or mine mu&#383;t be

an ancle or &#383;tep, be the &#383;acred

<h3><i>Introductory to a Series of Letters on the Pre&#383;ent
Character of the French Nation.</i></h3>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="right">Paris, February 15, 1793.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear friend,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is nece&#383;&#383;ary perhaps for an ob&#383;erver
of mankind, to guard as carefully the
remembrance of the fir&#383;t impre&#383;&#383;ion
made by a nation, as by a countenance;
becau&#383;e we imperceptibly lo&#383;e &#383;ight of
the national character, when we become
more intimate with individuals.
It is not then u&#383;ele&#383;s or pre&#383;umptuous
to note, that, when I fir&#383;t entered Paris,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-40_S" id="Pg_4-40_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-40.png">40</a>]</span>
the &#383;triking contra&#383;t of riches and poverty,
elegance and &#383;lovenline&#383;s, urbanity
and deceit, every where caught
my eye, and &#383;addened my &#383;oul; and
the&#383;e impre&#383;&#383;ions are &#383;till the foundation
of my remarks on the manners, which
flatter the &#383;en&#383;es, more than they intere&#383;t
the heart, and yet excite more intere&#383;t
than e&#383;teem.</p>

<p>The whole mode of life here tends
indeed to render the people frivolous,
and, to borrow their favourite epithet,
amiable. Ever on the wing, they are
always &#383;ipping the &#383;parkling joy on the
brim of the cup, leaving &#383;atiety in the
bottom for tho&#383;e who venture to drink
deep. On all &#383;ides they trip along,
buoyed up by animal &#383;pirits, and &#383;eemingly
&#383;o void of care, that often, when
I am walking on the <i>Boulevards</i>, it
occurs to me, that they alone under&#383;tand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-41_S" id="Pg_4-41_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-41.png">41</a>]</span>
the full import of the term lei&#383;ure; and
they trifle their time away with &#383;uch
an air of contentment, I know not how
to wi&#383;h them wi&#383;er at the expence of
their gaiety. They play before me like
motes in a &#383;unbeam, enjoying the pa&#383;&#383;ing
ray; whil&#383;t an Engli&#383;h head, &#383;earching
for more &#383;olid happine&#383;s, lo&#383;es, in
the analy&#383;is of plea&#383;ure, the volatile
&#383;weets of the moment. Their chief
enjoyment, it is true, ri&#383;es from vanity:
but it is not the vanity that engenders
vexation of &#383;pirit; on the contrary, it
lightens the heavy burthen of life,
which rea&#383;on too often weighs, merely
to &#383;hift from one &#383;houlder to the
other.</p>

<p>Inve&#383;tigating the modification of the
pa&#383;&#383;ion, as I would analyze the elements
that give a form to dead matter, I
&#383;hall attempt to trace to their &#383;ource<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-42_S" id="Pg_4-42_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-42.png">42</a>]</span>
the cau&#383;es which have combined to
render this nation the mo&#383;t poli&#383;hed, in
a phy&#383;ical &#383;en&#383;e, and probably the mo&#383;t
&#383;uperficial in the world; and I mean to
follow the windings of the various
&#383;treams that di&#383;embogue into a terrific
gulf, in which all the dignity of our
nature is ab&#383;orbed. For every thing
has con&#383;pired to make the French the
mo&#383;t &#383;en&#383;ual people in the world; and
what can render the heart &#383;o hard, or
&#383;o effectually &#383;tifle every moral emotion,
as the refinements of &#383;en&#383;uality?</p>

<p>The frequent repetition of the word
French, appears invidious; let me then
make a previous ob&#383;ervation, which I
beg you not to lo&#383;e &#383;ight of, when I
&#383;peak rather har&#383;hly of a land flowing
with milk and honey. Remember that
it is not the morals of a particular
people that I would decry; for are we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-43_S" id="Pg_4-43_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-43.png">43</a>]</span>
not all of the &#383;ame &#383;tock? But I wi&#383;h
calmly to con&#383;ider the &#383;tage of civilization
in which I find the French, and,
giving a &#383;ketch of their character, and
unfolding the circum&#383;tances which have
produced its identity, I &#383;hall endeavour
to throw &#383;ome light on the hi&#383;tory of
man, and on the pre&#383;ent important
&#383;ubjects of di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion.</p>

<p>I would I could fir&#383;t inform you that,
out of the chaos of vices and follies,
prejudices and virtues, rudely jumbled
together, I &#383;aw the fair form of Liberty
&#383;lowly ri&#383;ing, and Virtue expanding her
wings to &#383;helter all her children! I
&#383;hould then hear the account of the
barbarities that have rent the bo&#383;om of
France patiently, and ble&#383;s the firm
hand that lopt off the rotten limbs.
But, if the ari&#383;tocracy of birth is levelled
with the ground, only to make room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-44_S" id="Pg_4-44_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-44.png">44</a>]</span>
for that of riches, I am afraid that the
morals of the people will not be much
improved by the change, or the government
rendered le&#383;s venal. Still it
is not ju&#383;t to dwell on the mi&#383;ery produced
by the pre&#383;ent &#383;truggle, without
adverting to the &#383;tanding evils of the
old &#383;y&#383;tem. I am grieved&mdash;&#383;orely grieved&mdash;when
I think of the blood that has
&#383;tained the cau&#383;e of freedom at Paris;
but I al&#383;o hear the &#383;ame live &#383;tream cry
aloud from the highways, through
which the retreating armies pa&#383;&#383;ed
with famine and death in their rear,
and I hide my face with awe before
the in&#383;crutable ways of providence,
&#383;weeping in &#383;uch various directions the
be&#383;om of de&#383;truction over the &#383;ons of
men.</p>

<p>Before I came to France, I cheri&#383;hed,
you know, an opinion, that &#383;trong vir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-45_S" id="Pg_4-45_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-45.png">45</a>]</span>tues
might exi&#383;t with the poli&#383;hed manners
produced by the progre&#383;s of civilization;
and I even anticipated the
epoch, when, in the cour&#383;e of improvement,
men would labour to become
virtuous, without being goaded on by
mi&#383;ery. But now, the per&#383;pective of
the golden age, fading before the attentive
eye of ob&#383;ervation, almo&#383;t eludes
my &#383;ight; and, lo&#383;ing thus in part my
theory of a more perfect &#383;tate, &#383;tart not,
my friend, if I bring forward an opinion,
which at the fir&#383;t glance &#383;eems to
be levelled again&#383;t the exi&#383;tence of God!
I am not become an Athei&#383;t, I a&#383;&#383;ure
you, by re&#383;iding at Paris: yet I begin
to fear that vice, or, if you will, evil,
is the grand mobile of action, and that,
when the pa&#383;&#383;ions are ju&#383;tly poized, we
become harmle&#383;s, and in the &#383;ame proportion
u&#383;ele&#383;s.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-46_S" id="Pg_4-46_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-46.png">46</a>]</span>
The wants of rea&#383;on are very few;
and, were we to con&#383;ider di&#383;pa&#383;&#383;ionately
the real value of mo&#383;t things, we &#383;hould
probably re&#383;t &#383;ati&#383;fied with the &#383;imple
gratification of our phy&#383;ical nece&#383;&#383;ities,
and be content with negative goodne&#383;s:
for it is frequently, only that wanton,
the Imagination, with her artful
coquetry, who lures us forward, and
makes us run over a rough road, pu&#383;hing
a&#383;ide every ob&#383;tacle merely to catch
a di&#383;appointment.</p>

<p>The de&#383;ire al&#383;o of being u&#383;eful to
others, is continually damped by experience;
and, if the exertions of humanity
were not in &#383;ome mea&#383;ure their
own reward, who would endure mi&#383;ery,
or &#383;truggle with care, to make
&#383;ome people ungrateful, and others
idle?</p>

<p>You will call the&#383;e melancholy effu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-47_S" id="Pg_4-47_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-47.png">47</a>]</span>&#383;ions,
and gue&#383;s that, fatigued by the
vivacity, which has all the bu&#383;tling
folly of childhood, without the innocence
which renders ignorance charming,
I am too &#383;evere in my &#383;trictures.
It may be &#383;o; and I am aware that the
good effects of the revolution will be
la&#383;t felt at Paris; where &#383;urely the &#383;oul
of Epicurus has long been at work to
root out the &#383;imple emotions of the
heart, which, being natural, are always
moral. Rendered cold and artificial
by the &#383;elfi&#383;h enjoyments of the &#383;en&#383;es,
which the government fo&#383;tered, is it
&#383;urpri&#383;ing that &#383;implicity of manners,
and &#383;inglene&#383;s of heart, rarely appear,
to recreate me with the wild odour of
nature, &#383;o pa&#383;&#383;ing &#383;weet?</p>

<p>Seeing how deep the fibres of mi&#383;chief
have &#383;hot, I &#383;ometimes a&#383;k, with a
doubting accent, Whether a nation can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-48_S" id="Pg_4-48_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-48.png">48</a>]</span>
go back to the purity of manners which
has hitherto been maintained un&#383;ullied
only by the keen air of poverty, when,
ema&#383;culated by plea&#383;ure, the luxuries
of pro&#383;perity are become the wants of
nature? I cannot yet give up the hope,
that a fairer day is dawning on Europe,
though I mu&#383;t he&#383;itatingly ob&#383;erve, that
little is to be expected from the narrow
principle of commerce which &#383;eems
every where to be &#383;hoving a&#383;ide <i>the point
of honour</i> of the <i>noble&#383;&#383;e</i>. I can look beyond
the evils of the moment, and do
not expect muddied water to become
clear before it has had time to &#383;tand;
yet, even for the moment, it is the
mo&#383;t terrific of all &#383;ights, to &#383;ee men
vicious without warmth&mdash;to &#383;ee the
order that &#383;hould be the &#383;uper&#383;cription
of virtue, cultivated to give &#383;ecurity to
crimes which only thoughtle&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-49_S" id="Pg_4-49_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-49.png">49</a>]</span>
palliate. Di&#383;order is, in fact, the very
e&#383;&#383;ence of vice, though with the wild
wi&#383;hes of a corrupt fancy humane emotions
often kindly mix to &#383;often their
atrocity. Thus humanity, genero&#383;ity,
and even &#383;elf-denial, &#383;ometimes render
a character grand, and even u&#383;eful,
when hurried away by lawle&#383;s pa&#383;&#383;ions;
but what can equal the turpitude of a
cold calculator who lives for him&#383;elf
alone, and con&#383;idering his fellow-creatures
merely as machines of plea&#383;ure,
never forgets that hone&#383;ty is the be&#383;t policy?
Keeping ever within the pale of
the law, he cru&#383;hes his thou&#383;ands with
impunity; but it is with that degree of
management, which makes him, to borrow
a &#383;ignificant vulgari&#383;m, a villain
<i>in grain</i>. The very exce&#383;s of his depravation
pre&#383;erves him, whil&#383;t the more
re&#383;pectable bea&#383;t of prey, who prowls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-50_S" id="Pg_4-50_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-50.png">50</a>]</span>
about like the lion, and roars to announce
his approach, falls into a &#383;nare.</p>

<p>You may think it too &#383;oon to form
an opinion of the future government,
yet it is impo&#383;&#383;ible to avoid hazarding
&#383;ome conjectures, when every thing
whi&#383;pers me, that names, not principles,
are changed, and when I &#383;ee that
the turn of the tide has left the dregs of
the old &#383;y&#383;tem to corrupt the new. For
the &#383;ame pride of office, the &#383;ame de&#383;ire
of power are &#383;till vi&#383;ible; with this aggravation,
that, fearing to return to ob&#383;curity
after having but ju&#383;t acquired
a reli&#383;h for di&#383;tinction, each hero, or
philo&#383;opher, for all are dubbed with
the&#383;e new titles, endeavours to make
hay while the &#383;un &#383;hines; and every
petty municipal officer, become the idol,
or rather the tyrant of the day, &#383;talks
like a cock on a dunghil.</p>

letter; which however will enable you
to fore&#383;ee that I &#383;hall treat more of
morals than manners.</p>

<h3>ON THE</h3>
<h2>MANAGEMENT OF INFANTS.</h2>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I ought</span> to apologize for not having
written to you on the &#383;ubject you
mentioned; but, to tell you the truth,
it grew upon me: and, in&#383;tead of an
an&#383;wer, I have begun a &#383;eries of letters
on the management of children in
their infancy. Replying then to your
que&#383;tion, I have the public in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-56_S" id="Pg_4-56_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-56.png">56</a>]</span>
thoughts, and &#383;hall endeavour to &#383;how
what modes appear to me nece&#383;&#383;ary,
to render the infancy of children more
healthy and happy. I have long
thought, that the cau&#383;e which renders
children as hard to rear as the mo&#383;t
fragile plant, is our deviation from
&#383;implicity. I know that &#383;ome able
phy&#383;icians have recommended the method
I have pur&#383;ued, and I mean to
point out the good effects I have ob&#383;erved
in practice. I am aware that
many matrons will exclaim again&#383;t me,
and dwell on the number of children
they have brought up, as their mothers
did before them, without troubling
them&#383;elves with new-fangled notions;
yet, though, in my uncle Toby's words,
they &#383;hould attempt to &#383;ilence me, by
"wi&#383;hing I had &#383;een their large" families,
I mu&#383;t &#383;uppo&#383;e, while a third part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-57_S" id="Pg_4-57_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-57.png">57</a>]</span>
of the human &#383;pecies, according to the
mo&#383;t accurate calculation, die during
their infancy, ju&#383;t at the thre&#383;hold of
life, that there is &#383;ome error in the
modes adopted by mothers and nur&#383;es,
which counteracts their own endeavours.
I may be mi&#383;taken in &#383;ome
particulars; for general rules, founded
on the &#383;ounde&#383;t rea&#383;on, demand individual
modification; but, if I can per&#383;uade
any of the ri&#383;ing generation to
exerci&#383;e their rea&#383;on on this head, I am
content. My advice will probably
be found mo&#383;t u&#383;eful to mothers in the
middle cla&#383;s; and it is from them that
the lower imperceptibly gains improvement.
Cu&#383;tom, produced by rea&#383;on
in one, may &#383;afely be the effect of
imitation in the other.</p>

<h4>LETTER I</h4>

<p class="right">Dublin, April 14, [1787.]</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Dear &#383;ir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> &#383;till an invalid&mdash;and begin to
believe that I ought never to expect to
enjoy health. My mind preys on my
body&mdash;and, when I endeavour to be
u&#383;eful, I grow too much intere&#383;ted for
my own peace. Confined almo&#383;t entirely
to the &#383;ociety of children, I am
anxiou&#383;ly &#383;olicitous for their future
welfare, and mortified beyond mea&#383;ure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-62_S" id="Pg_4-62_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-62.png">62</a>]</span>
when counteracted in my endeavours to
improve them.&mdash;I feel all a mother's
fears for the &#383;warm of little ones which
&#383;urround me, and ob&#383;erve di&#383;orders,
without having power to apply the
proper remedies. How can I be reconciled
to life, when it is always a
painful warfare, and when I am deprived
of all the plea&#383;ures I reli&#383;h?&mdash;I
allude to rational conver&#383;ations, and
dome&#383;tic affections. Here, alone, a
poor &#383;olitary individual in a &#383;trange
land, tied to one &#383;pot, and &#383;ubject to
the caprice of another, can I be contented?
I am de&#383;irous to convince you
that I have <i>&#383;ome</i> cau&#383;e for &#383;orrow&mdash;and
am not without rea&#383;on detached from
life. I &#383;hall hope to hear that you are
well, and am yours &#383;incerely</p>

<h4>LETTER II</h4>

<p class="right">Henley, Thur&#383;day, Sept 13.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear &#383;ir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I &#383;aw you, I have, literally
&#383;peaking, <i>enjoyed</i> &#383;olitude. My &#383;i&#383;ter
could not accompany me in my rambles;
I therefore wandered alone, by
the &#383;ide of the Thames, and in the
neighbouring beautiful fields and
plea&#383;ure grounds: the pro&#383;pects were
of &#383;uch a placid kind, I <i>caught</i> tranquillity
while I &#383;urveyed them&mdash;my mind
was <i>&#383;till</i>, though active. Were I to
give you an account how I have &#383;pent
my time, you would &#383;mile.&mdash;I found an
old French bible here, and amu&#383;ed
my&#383;elf with comparing it with our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-64_S" id="Pg_4-64_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-64.png">64</a>]</span>
Engli&#383;h tran&#383;lation; then I would li&#383;ten
to the falling leaves, or ob&#383;erve the
various tints the autumn gave to
them&mdash;At other times, the &#383;inging of
a robin, or the noi&#383;e of a water-mill,
engaged my attention&mdash;partial attention&mdash;,
for I was, at the &#383;ame time
perhaps di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing &#383;ome knotty point,
or &#383;traying from this <i>tiny</i> world to new
&#383;y&#383;tems. After the&#383;e excur&#383;ions, I returned
to the family meals, told the
children &#383;tories (they think me <i>va&#383;tly</i>
agreeable), and my &#383;i&#383;ter was amu&#383;ed.&mdash;Well,
will you allow me to call this
way of pa&#383;&#383;ing my days plea&#383;ant?</p>

<p>I was ju&#383;t going to mend my pen;
but I believe it will enable me to &#383;ay
all I have to add to this epi&#383;tle. Have
you yet heard of an habitation for me?
I often think of my new plan of life;
and, le&#383;t my &#383;i&#383;ter &#383;hould try to prevail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-65_S" id="Pg_4-65_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-65.png">65</a>]</span>
on me to alter it, I have avoided mentioning
it to her. I am determined!&mdash;Your
&#383;ex generally laugh at female
determinations; but let me tell you,
I never yet re&#383;olved to do, any thing of
con&#383;equence, that I did not adhere re&#383;olutely
to it, till I had accompli&#383;hed
my purpo&#383;e, improbable as it might
have appeared to a more timid mind.
In the cour&#383;e of near nine-and-twenty
years, I have gathered &#383;ome experience,
and felt many <i>&#383;evere</i> di&#383;appointments&mdash;and
what is the amount? I long for a
little peace and <i>independence</i>! Every
obligation we receive from our fellow-creatures
is a new &#383;hackle, takes from
our native freedom, and deba&#383;es the
mind, makes us mere earthworms&mdash;I
am not fond of grovelling!</p>

<p class="right">I am, &#383;ir, yours, &amp;c.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<h4>LETTER III</h4>

<p class="right">Market Harborough, Sept. 20.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear &#383;ir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> left me with three opulent
trade&#383;men; their conver&#383;ation was not
calculated to beguile the way, when
the &#383;able curtain concealed the beauties
of nature. I li&#383;tened to the tricks
of trade&mdash;and &#383;hrunk away, without
wi&#383;hing to grow rich; even the novelty
of the &#383;ubjects did not render them
plea&#383;ing; fond as I am of tracing the
pa&#383;&#383;ions in all their different forms&mdash;I
was not &#383;urpri&#383;ed by any glimp&#383;e of the
&#383;ublime, or beautiful&mdash;though one of
them imagined I would be a u&#383;eful partner
in a good <i>firm</i>. I was very much
fatigued, and have &#383;carcely recovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-67_S" id="Pg_4-67_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-67.png">67</a>]</span>
my&#383;elf. I do not expect to enjoy the
&#383;ame tranquil plea&#383;ures Henley afforded:
I meet with new objects to employ
my mind; but many painful emotions
are complicated with the reflections
they give ri&#383;e to.</p>

<p>I do not intend to enter on the <i>old</i>
topic, yet hope to hear from you&mdash;and
am yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary woll&#383;tonecraft.</span></p>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER IV</h4>

<p class="right">Friday Night.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear &#383;ir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> your remarks are generally
judicious&mdash;I cannot <i>now</i> concur with you,
I mean with re&#383;pect to the preface<a name="FNanchor_67-A_21_S" id="FNanchor_67-A_21_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_67-A_21_S" class="fnanchor">[67-A]</a>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-68_S" id="Pg_4-68_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-68.png">68</a>]</span>
and have not altered it. I hate the
u&#383;ual &#383;mooth way of exhibiting proud
humility. A general rule <i>only</i> extends
to the majority&mdash;and, believe me, the
few judicious parents who may peru&#383;e
my book, will not feel them&#383;elves hurt&mdash;and
the weak are too vain to mind what
is &#383;aid in a book intended for children.</p>

<p>I return you the Italian MS.&mdash;but
do not ha&#383;tily imagine that I am indolent.
I would not &#383;pare any labour to
do my duty&mdash;and, after the mo&#383;t laborious
day, that &#383;ingle thought would
&#383;olace me more than any plea&#383;ures the
&#383;en&#383;es could enjoy. I find I could not
tran&#383;late the MS. well. If it was not
a MS, I &#383;hould not be &#383;o ea&#383;ily intimidated;
but the hand, and errors in
orthography, or abbreviations, are a
&#383;tumbling-block at the fir&#383;t &#383;etting
out.&mdash;I cannot bear to do any thing I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-69_S" id="Pg_4-69_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-69.png">69</a>]</span>
cannot do well&mdash;and I &#383;hould lo&#383;e time
in the vain attempt.</p>

<p>I had, the other day, the &#383;ati&#383;faction
of again receiving a letter from my
poor, dear Margaret<a name="FNanchor_69-A_22_S" id="FNanchor_69-A_22_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_69-A_22_S" class="fnanchor">[69-A]</a>.&mdash;With all a
mother's fondne&#383;s I could tran&#383;cribe a
part of it&mdash;She &#383;ays, every day her
affection to me, and dependence on
heaven increa&#383;e, &amp;c.&mdash;I mi&#383;s her
innocent care&#383;&#383;es&mdash;and &#383;ometimes indulge
a plea&#383;ing hope, that &#383;he may be
allowed to cheer my childle&#383;s age&mdash;if
I am to live to be old.&mdash;At any rate, I
may hear of the virtues I may not contemplate&mdash;and
my rea&#383;on may permit
me to love a female.&mdash;I now allude to
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. I have received another letter
from her, and her childi&#383;h complaints
vex me&mdash;indeed they do&mdash;As
u&#383;ual, good-night.</p>

<p>If parents attended to their children,
I would not have written the &#383;tories;
for, what are books&mdash;compared to conver&#383;ations
which affection inforces!&mdash;</p>

<h4>LETTER V</h4>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear &#383;ir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remember</span> you are to &#383;ettle <i>my account</i>,
as I want to know how much I
am in your debt&mdash;but do not &#383;uppo&#383;e
that I feel any unea&#383;ine&#383;s on that &#383;core.
The generality of people in trade

<p class="right">Friday Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> &#383;ick with vexation&mdash;and wi&#383;h
I could knock my fooli&#383;h head again&#383;t

To &#383;ay the truth, I was never more di&#383;plea&#383;ed
with my&#383;elf, and I will tell you
the cau&#383;e.&mdash;You may recollect that I
did not mention to you the circum&#383;tance
of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; having a fortune left

me when I conver&#383;ed with my &#383;i&#383;ter;
becau&#383;e I knew he had a &#383;ufficient motive

<h4>LETTER VII</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I am become a reviewer, I think
it right, in the way of bu&#383;ine&#383;s, to con&#383;ider
the &#383;ubject. You have alarmed
the editor of the Critical, as the adverti&#383;ement
prefixed to the Appendix<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-74_S" id="Pg_4-74_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-74.png">74</a>]</span>
plainly &#383;hows. The Critical appears
to me to be a timid, mean production,
and its &#383;ucce&#383;s is a reflection on the
ta&#383;te and judgment of the public; but,
as a body, who ever gave it credit for
much? The voice of the people is only
the voice of truth, when &#383;ome man of
abilities has had time to get fa&#383;t hold of
the <span class="smcap">great no&#383;e</span> of the mon&#383;ter. Of
cour&#383;e, local fame is generally a
clamour, and dies away. The Appendix
to the Monthly afforded me more
amu&#383;ement, though every article almo&#383;t
wants energy and a <i>cant</i> of virtue and
liberality is &#383;trewed over it; always
tame, and eager to pay court to e&#383;tabli&#383;hed
fame. The account of Necker
is one unvaried tone of admiration.
Surely men were born only to provide
for the &#383;u&#383;tenance of the body by enfeebling
the mind!</p>

plain terms, what I think. I have ever
con&#383;idered you in the light of a <i>civil</i>
acquaintance&mdash;on the word friend I lay
a peculiar empha&#383;is&mdash;and, as a mere
acquaintance, you were rude and <i>cruel</i>,
to &#383;tep forward to in&#383;ult a woman,
who&#383;e conduct and mi&#383;fortunes demand
re&#383;pect. If my friend, Mr. John&#383;on,
had made the propo&#383;al&mdash;I &#383;hould have
been &#383;everely hurt&mdash;have thought him
unkind and unfeeling, but not <i>impertinent</i>.&mdash;The
privilege of intimacy you
had no claim to&mdash;and &#383;hould have referred
the man to my&#383;elf&mdash;if you had
not &#383;ufficient di&#383;cernment to qua&#383;h it at
once. I am, &#383;ir, poor and de&#383;titute.&mdash;Yet
I have a &#383;pirit that will never bend,
or take indirect methods, to obtain the
con&#383;equence I de&#383;pi&#383;e; nay, if to &#383;upport
life it was nece&#383;&#383;ary to act contrary
to my principles, the &#383;truggle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-87_S" id="Pg_4-87_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-87.png">87</a>]</span>
would &#383;oon be over. I can bear any
thing but my own contempt.</p>

<p>In a few words, what I call an in&#383;ult,
is the bare &#383;uppo&#383;ition that I could for
a moment think of <i>pro&#383;tituting</i> my per&#383;on
for a maintenance; for in that point of
view does &#383;uch a marriage appear to
me, who con&#383;ider right and wrong in
the ab&#383;tract, and never by words and
local opinions &#383;hield my&#383;elf from the
reproaches of my own heart and under&#383;tanding.</p>

<p>It is needle&#383;s to &#383;ay more&mdash;Only you
mu&#383;t excu&#383;e me when I add, that I wi&#383;h

home with compo&#383;ed counte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-93_S" id="Pg_4-93_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-93.png">93</a>]</span>nances,
&#383;houldering their arms. About
nine o'clock this morning, the king
pa&#383;&#383;ed by my window, moving &#383;ilently
along (excepting now and then a few
&#383;trokes on the drum, which rendered
the &#383;tillne&#383;s more awful) through empty
&#383;treets, &#383;urrounded by the national guards,
who, clu&#383;tering round the carriage,
&#383;eemed to de&#383;erve their name. The
inhabitants flocked to their windows,
but the ca&#383;ements were all &#383;hut, not a
voice was heard, nor did I &#383;ee any
thing like an in&#383;ulting ge&#383;ture.&mdash;For
the fir&#383;t time &#383;ince I entered France,
I bowed to the maje&#383;ty of the people,
and re&#383;pected the propriety of behaviour
&#383;o perfectly in uni&#383;on with my own
feelings. I can &#383;carcely tell you why,
but an a&#383;&#383;ociation of ideas made the
tears flow in&#383;en&#383;ibly from my eyes,
when I &#383;aw Louis &#383;itting, with more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-94_S" id="Pg_4-94_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-94.png">94</a>]</span>
dignity than I expected from his character,
in a hackney coach, going to
meet death, where &#383;o many of his race
have triumphed. My fancy in&#383;tantly
brought Louis XIV before me, entering
the capital with all his pomp, after
one of the victories mo&#383;t flattering to
his pride, only to &#383;ee the &#383;un&#383;hine of
pro&#383;perity over&#383;hadowed by the &#383;ublime
gloom of mi&#383;ery. I have been alone
ever &#383;ince; and, though my mind is
calm, I cannot di&#383;mi&#383;s the lively images
that have filled my imagination all the
day.&mdash;Nay, do not &#383;mile, but pity me;
for, once or twice, lifting my eyes from
the paper, I have &#383;een eyes glare
through a gla&#383;s-door oppo&#383;ite my chair
and bloody hands &#383;hook at me. Not
the di&#383;tant &#383;ound of a foot&#383;tep can I
hear.&mdash;My apartments are remote from
tho&#383;e of the &#383;ervants, the only per&#383;ons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-95_S" id="Pg_4-95_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-95.png">95</a>]</span>
who &#383;leep with me in an immen&#383;e hotel,
one folding door opening after another.&mdash;I
wi&#383;h I had even kept the cat with
me!&mdash;I want to &#383;ee &#383;omething alive;
death in &#383;o many frightful &#383;hapes has
taken hold of my fancy.&mdash;I am going to
bed&mdash;and, for the fir&#383;t time in my life, I
cannot put out the candle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ye</span> who expect con&#383;tancy where every
thing is changing, and peace in the
mid&#383;t of tumult, attend to the voice of
experience, and mark in time the foot&#383;teps

<p>In a &#383;eque&#383;tered valley, &#383;urrounded by
rocky mountains that intercepted many
of the pa&#383;&#383;ing clouds, though &#383;unbeams
variegated their ample &#383;ides, lived a
&#383;age, to whom nature had unlocked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-100_S" id="Pg_4-100_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-100.png">100</a>]</span>
her mo&#383;t hidden &#383;ecrets. His hollow
eyes, &#383;unk in their orbits, retired from
the view of vulgar objects, and turned
inwards, overleaped the boundary pre&#383;cribed
to human knowledge. Inten&#383;e
thinking during four&#383;core and ten years,
had whitened the &#383;cattered locks on
his head, which, like the &#383;ummit of
the di&#383;tant mountain, appeared to be
bound by an eternal fro&#383;t.</p>

<p>On the &#383;andy wa&#383;te behind the mountains,
the track of ferocious bea&#383;ts
might be traced, and &#383;ometimes the
mangled limbs which they left, attracted
a hovering flight of birds of prey. An
exten&#383;ive wood the &#383;age had forced to
rear its head in a &#383;oil by no means congenial,
and the firm trunks of the trees
&#383;eemed to frown with defiance on time;
though the &#383;poils of innumerable &#383;ummers
covered the roots, which re&#383;embled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-101_S" id="Pg_4-101_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-101.png">101</a>]</span>
fangs; &#383;o clo&#383;ely did they cling to the
unfriendly &#383;and, where &#383;erpents hi&#383;&#383;ed,
and &#383;nakes, rolling out their va&#383;t folds,
inhaled the noxious vapours. The ravens
and owls who inhabited the &#383;olitude,
gave al&#383;o a thicker gloom to the
everla&#383;ting twilight, and the croaking
of the former a monotony, in uni&#383;on
with the gloom; whil&#383;t lions and tygers,
&#383;hunning even this faint &#383;emblance of
day, &#383;ought the dark caverns, and at
night, when they &#383;hook off &#383;leep, their
roaring would make the whole valley
re&#383;ound, confounded with the &#383;creechings
of the bird of night.</p>

<p>One mountain ro&#383;e &#383;ublime, towering
above all, on the craggy &#383;ides of which
a few &#383;ea-weeds grew, wa&#383;hed by the
ocean, that with tumultuous roar ru&#383;hed
to a&#383;&#383;ault, and even undermine, the
huge barrier that &#383;topped its progre&#383;s;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-102_S" id="Pg_4-102_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-102.png">102</a>]</span>
and ever and anon a ponderous ma&#383;s,
loo&#383;ened from the cliff, to which it
&#383;carcely &#383;eemed to adhere, always threatening
to fall, fell into the flood, rebounding
as it fell, and the &#383;ound was re-echoed
from rock to rock. Look where
you would, all was without form, as
if nature, &#383;uddenly &#383;topping her hand,
had left chaos a retreat.</p>

<p>Clo&#383;e to the mo&#383;t remote &#383;ide of it
was the &#383;age's abode. It was a rude
hut, formed of &#383;tumps of trees and
matted twigs, to &#383;ecure him from the
inclemency of the weather; only through
&#383;mall apertures cro&#383;&#383;ed with ru&#383;hes, the
wind entered in wild murmurs, modulated
by the&#383;e ob&#383;tructions. A clear
&#383;pring broke out of the middle of the
adjacent rock, which, dropping &#383;lowly
into a cavity it had hollowed, &#383;oon
overflowed, and then ran, &#383;truggling to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-103_S" id="Pg_4-103_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-103.png">103</a>]</span>
free it&#383;elf from the cumbrous fragments,
till, become a deep, &#383;ilent &#383;tream, it
e&#383;caped through reeds, and roots of
trees, who&#383;e bla&#383;ted tops overhung and
darkened the current.</p>

<p>One &#383;ide of the hut was &#383;upported by
the rock, and at midnight, when the
&#383;age &#383;truck the inclo&#383;ed part, it yawned
wide, and admitted him into a cavern in
the very bowels of the earth, where
never human foot before had trod; and
the various &#383;pirits, which inhabit the
different regions of nature, were here
obedient to his potent word. The cavern
had been formed by the great
inundation of waters, when the approach
of a comet forced them from
their &#383;ource; then, when the fountains
of the great deep were broken up,
a &#383;tream ru&#383;hed out of the centre of the
earth, where the &#383;pirits, who have lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-104_S" id="Pg_4-104_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-104.png">104</a>]</span>
on it, are confined to purify them&#383;elves
from the dro&#383;s contracted in their fir&#383;t
&#383;tage of exi&#383;tence; and it flowed in
black waves, for ever bubbling along
the cave, the extent of which had never
been explored. From the &#383;ides and
top, water di&#383;tilled, and, petrifying as
it fell, took fanta&#383;tic &#383;hapes, that &#383;oon
divided it into apartments, if &#383;o they
might be called. In the foam, a wearied
&#383;pirit would &#383;ometimes ri&#383;e, to catch
the mo&#383;t di&#383;tant glimp&#383;e of light, or
ta&#383;te the vagrant breeze, which the
yawning of the rock admitted, when
Sage&#383;tus, for that was the name of the
hoary &#383;age, entered. Some, who were
refined and almo&#383;t cleared from vicious
&#383;pots, he would allow to leave, for a limited
time, their dark pri&#383;on-hou&#383;e;
and, flying on the winds acro&#383;s the bleak
northern ocean, or ri&#383;ing in an exhala<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-105_S" id="Pg_4-105_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-105.png">105</a>]</span>tion
till they reached a &#383;un-beam, they
thus re-vi&#383;ited the haunts of men. The&#383;e
were the guardian angels, who in &#383;oft
whi&#383;pers re&#383;train the vicious, and animate
the wavering wretch who &#383;tands
&#383;u&#383;pended between virtue and vice.</p>

<p>Sage&#383;tus had &#383;pent a night in the cavern,
as he often did, and he left the
&#383;ilent ve&#383;tibule of the grave, ju&#383;t as the
&#383;un, emerging from the ocean, di&#383;per&#383;ed
the clouds, which were not half
&#383;o den&#383;e as tho&#383;e he had left. All that
was human in him rejoiced at the &#383;ight
of reviving life, and he viewed with
plea&#383;ure the mounting &#383;ap ri&#383;ing to expand
the herbs, which grew &#383;pontaneou&#383;ly
in this wild&mdash;when, turning his
eyes towards the &#383;ea, he found that
death had been at work during his ab&#383;ence,
and terrific marks of a furious
&#383;torm &#383;till &#383;pread horror around. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-106_S" id="Pg_4-106_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-106.png">106</a>]</span>
the day was &#383;erene, and threw bright
rays on eyes for ever &#383;hut, it dawned
not for the wretches who hung pendent
on the craggy rocks, or were &#383;tretched
lifele&#383;s on the &#383;and. Some, &#383;truggling,
had dug them&#383;elves a grave; others
had re&#383;igned their breath before the
impetuous &#383;urge whirled them on &#383;hore.
A few, in whom the vital &#383;park was
not &#383;o &#383;oon di&#383;lodged, had clung to
loo&#383;e fragments; it was the gra&#383;p of
death; embracing the &#383;tone, they &#383;tiffened;
and the head, no longer erect,
re&#383;ted on the ma&#383;s which the arms encircled.
It felt not the agonizing gripe,
nor heard the &#383;igh that broke the heart
in twain.</p>

<p>Re&#383;ting his chin on an oaken club,
the &#383;age looked on every &#383;ide, to &#383;ee
if he could di&#383;cern any who yet breathed.
He drew nearer, and thought he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-107_S" id="Pg_4-107_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-107.png">107</a>]</span>
&#383;aw, at the fir&#383;t glance, the unclo&#383;ed eyes
glare; but &#383;oon perceived that they
were a mere gla&#383;&#383;y &#383;ub&#383;tance, mute as
the tongue; the jaws were fallen, and,
in &#383;ome of the tangled locks, hands
were clinched; nay, even the nails
had entered &#383;harpened by de&#383;pair. The
blood flew rapidly to his heart; it was
fle&#383;h; he felt he was &#383;till a man, and
the big tear paced down his iron cheeks,
who&#383;e mu&#383;cles had not for a long time
been relaxed by &#383;uch humane emotions.
A moment he breathed quick, then
heaved a &#383;igh, and his wonted calm
returned with an unaccu&#383;tomed glow
of tenderne&#383;s; for the ways of heaven
were not hid from him; he lifted up
his eyes to the common Father of nature,
and all was as &#383;till in his bo&#383;om, as
the &#383;mooth deep, after having clo&#383;ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-108_S" id="Pg_4-108_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-108.png">108</a>]</span>
over the huge ve&#383;&#383;el from which the
wretches had fled.</p>

<p>Turning round a part of the rock
that jutted out, meditating on the ways
of Providence, a weak infantine voice
reached his ears; it was li&#383;ping out the
name of mother. He looked, and beheld
a blooming child leaning over, and
ki&#383;&#383;ing with eager fondne&#383;s, lips that
were in&#383;en&#383;ible to the warm pre&#383;&#383;ure.
Starting at the &#383;ight of the &#383;age, &#383;he
fixed her eyes on him, "Wake her,
ah! wake her," &#383;he cried, "or the
&#383;ea will catch us." Again he felt compa&#383;&#383;ion,
for he &#383;aw that the mother
&#383;lept the &#383;leep of death. He &#383;tretched
out his hand, and, &#383;moothing his brow,
invited her to approach; but &#383;he &#383;till
intreated him to wake her mother,
whom &#383;he continued to call, with an
impatient tremulous voice. To detach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-109_S" id="Pg_4-109_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-109.png">109</a>]</span>
her from the body by per&#383;ua&#383;ion would
not have been very ea&#383;y. Sage&#383;tus had
a quicker method to effect his purpo&#383;e;
he took out a box which contained a
&#383;oporific powder, and as &#383;oon as the
fumes reached her brain, the powers of
life were &#383;u&#383;pended.</p>

<p>He carried her directly to his hut,
and left her &#383;leeping profoundly on his
ru&#383;hy couch.</p>

<h2><a name="V4_CHAP_II_S" id="V4_CHAP_II_S"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> Sage&#383;tus approached the
dead, to view them with a more &#383;crutinizing
eye. He was perfectly acquainted
with the con&#383;truction of the
human body, knew the traces that virtue
or vice leaves on the whole frame;
they were now indelibly fixed by death;
nay more, he knew by the &#383;hape of
the &#383;olid &#383;tructure, how far the &#383;pirit
could range, and &#383;aw the barrier beyond
which it could not pa&#383;s: the mazes of
fancy he explored, mea&#383;ured the &#383;tretch
of thought, and, weighing all in an
even balance, could tell whom nature
had &#383;tamped an hero, a poet, or philo&#383;opher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-111_S" id="Pg_4-111_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-111.png">111</a>]</span>
By their appearance, at a tran&#383;ient
glance, he knew that the ve&#383;&#383;el mu&#383;t
have contained many pa&#383;&#383;engers, and
that &#383;ome of them were above the vulgar,
with re&#383;pect to fortune and education;
he then walked lei&#383;urely among
the dead, and narrowly ob&#383;erved their
pallid features.</p>

<p>His eye fir&#383;t re&#383;ted on a form in which
proportion reigned, and, &#383;troking back
the hair, a &#383;pacious forehead met his
view; warm fancy had revelled there,
and her airy dance had left ve&#383;tiges,
&#383;carcely vi&#383;ible to a mortal eye. Some
perpendicular lines pointed out that
melancholy had predominated in his
con&#383;titution; yet the &#383;traggling hairs
of his eye-brows &#383;howed that anger had
often &#383;hook his frame; indeed, the
four temperatures, like the four elements,
had re&#383;ided in this little world,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-112_S" id="Pg_4-112_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-112.png">112</a>]</span>
and produced harmony. The whole
vi&#383;age was bony, and an energetic
frown had knit the flexible &#383;kin of his
brow; the kingdom within had been
exten&#383;ive; and the wild creations of
fancy had there "a local habitation
and a name." So exqui&#383;ite was his
&#383;en&#383;ibility, &#383;o quick his comprehen&#383;ion,
that he perceived various combinations
in an in&#383;tant; he caught truth as &#383;he
darted towards him, &#383;aw all her fair
proportion at a glance, and the fla&#383;h of
his eye &#383;poke the quick &#383;en&#383;es which
conveyed intelligence to his mind; the
&#383;en&#383;orium indeed was capacious, and
the &#383;age imagined he &#383;aw the lucid
beam, &#383;parkling with love or ambition,
in characters of fire, which a graceful
curve of the upper eyelid &#383;haded. The
lips were a little deranged by contempt;
and a mixture of vanity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-113_S" id="Pg_4-113_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-113.png">113</a>]</span>
&#383;elf-complacency formed a few irregular
lines round them. The chin had
&#383;uffered from &#383;en&#383;uality, yet there were
&#383;till great marks of vigour in it, as if
advanced with &#383;tern dignity. The
hand accu&#383;tomed to command, and even
tyrannize, was unnerved; but its appearance
convinced Sage&#383;tus, that he
had oftener wielded a thought than a
weapon; and that he had &#383;ilenced, by
irre&#383;i&#383;tible conviction, the &#383;uperficial
di&#383;putant, and the being, who doubted
becau&#383;e he had not &#383;trength to believe,
who, wavering between different borrowed
opinions, fir&#383;t caught at one
&#383;traw, then at another, unable to &#383;ettle
into any con&#383;i&#383;tency of character. After
gazing a few moments, Sage&#383;tus turned
away exclaiming, How are the &#383;tately
oaks torn up by a tempe&#383;t, and the bow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-114_S" id="Pg_4-114_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-114.png">114</a>]</span>
un&#383;trung, that could force the arrow
beyond the ken of the eye!</p>

<p>What a different face next met his
view! The forehead was &#383;hort, yet well
&#383;et together; the no&#383;e &#383;mall, but a little
turned up at the end; and a draw-down
at the &#383;ides of his mouth, proved that
he had been a humouri&#383;t, who minded
the main chance, and could joke with
his acquaintance, while he eagerly devoured
a dainty which he was not to
pay for. His lips &#383;hut like a box who&#383;e
hinges had often been mended; and
the mu&#383;cles, which di&#383;play the &#383;oft emotion
of the heart on the cheeks, were
grown quite rigid, &#383;o that, the ve&#383;&#383;els
that &#383;hould have moi&#383;tened them not
having much communication with the
grand &#383;ource of pa&#383;&#383;ions, the fine volatile
fluid had evaporated, and they
became mere dry fibres, which might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-115_S" id="Pg_4-115_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-115.png">115</a>]</span>
be pulled by any mi&#383;fortune that
threatened him&#383;elf, but were not &#383;ufficiently
ela&#383;tic to be moved by the
mi&#383;eries of others. His joints were
in&#383;erted compactly, and with celerity
they had performed all the animal
functions, without any of the grace
which re&#383;ults from the imagination
mixing with the &#383;en&#383;es.</p>

<p>A huge form was &#383;tretched near him,
that exhibited marks of overgrown
infancy; every part was relaxed; all
appeared imperfect. Yet, &#383;ome undulating
lines on the puffed-out cheeks,
di&#383;played &#383;igns of timid, &#383;ervile good
nature; and the &#383;kin of the forehead
had been &#383;o often drawn up by wonder,
that the few hairs of the eyebrows were
fixed in a &#383;harp arch, whil&#383;t an ample
chin re&#383;ted in lobes of fle&#383;h on his protuberant
brea&#383;t.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-116_S" id="Pg_4-116_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-116.png">116</a>]</span>
By his &#383;ide was a body that had
&#383;carcely ever much life in it&mdash;&#383;ympathy
&#383;eemed to have drawn them together&mdash;every
feature and limb was round and
fle&#383;hy, and, if a kind of brutal cunning
had not marked the face, it might have
been mi&#383;taken for an automaton, &#383;o unmixed
was the phlegmatic fluid. The
vital &#383;park was buried deep in a &#383;oft
ma&#383;s of matter, re&#383;embling the pith in
young elder, which, when found, is &#383;o
equivocal, that it only appears a moi&#383;ter
part of the &#383;ame body.</p>

<p>Another part of the beach was
covered with &#383;ailors, who&#383;e bodies exhibited
marks of &#383;trength and brutal
courage.&mdash;Their characters were all
different, though of the &#383;ame cla&#383;s;
Sage&#383;tus did not &#383;tay to di&#383;criminate
them, &#383;ati&#383;fied with a rough &#383;ketch.
He &#383;aw indolence rou&#383;ed by a love of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-117_S" id="Pg_4-117_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-117.png">117</a>]</span>
humour, or rather bodily fun; &#383;en&#383;uality
and prodigality with a vein of genero&#383;ity
running through it; a contempt
of danger with gro&#383;s &#383;uper&#383;tition;
&#383;upine &#383;en&#383;es, only to be kept alive by
noi&#383;y, tumultuous plea&#383;ures, or that
kind of novelty which borders on ab&#383;urdity:
this formed the common outline,
and the re&#383;t were rather dabs than
&#383;hades.</p>

<p>Sage&#383;tus pau&#383;ed, and remembered it
had been &#383;aid by an earthly wit, that
"many a flower is born to blu&#383;h un&#383;een,
and wa&#383;te its &#383;weetne&#383;s on the
de&#383;art air." How little, he exclaimed,
did that poet know of the ways of
heaven! And yet, in this re&#383;pect, they
are direct; the hands before me, were
de&#383;igned to pull a rope, knock down a
&#383;heep, or perform the &#383;ervile offices of
life; no "mute, inglorious poet" re&#383;ts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-118_S" id="Pg_4-118_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-118.png">118</a>]</span>
among&#383;t them, and he who is &#383;uperior
to his fellow, does not ri&#383;e above mediocrity.
The genius that &#383;prouts from
a dunghil &#383;oon &#383;hakes off the heterogenous
ma&#383;s; tho&#383;e only grovel, who
have not power to fly.</p>

<p>He turned his &#383;tep towards the mother
of the orphan: another female
was at &#383;ome di&#383;tance; and a man who,
by his garb, might have been the hu&#383;band,
or brother, of the former, was
not far off.</p>

<p>Him the &#383;age &#383;urveyed with an attentive
eye, and bowed with re&#383;pect
to the inanimate clay, that lately had
been the dwelling of a mo&#383;t benevolent
&#383;pirit. The head was &#383;quare, though
the features were not very prominent;
but there was a great harmony in every
part, and the turn of the no&#383;trils and
lips evinced, that the &#383;oul mu&#383;t have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-119_S" id="Pg_4-119_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-119.png">119</a>]</span>
had ta&#383;te, to which they had &#383;erved as
organs. Penetration and judgment
were &#383;eated on the brows that overhung
the eye. Fixed as it was, Sage&#383;tus
quickly di&#383;cerned the expre&#383;&#383;ion
it mu&#383;t have had; dark and pen&#383;ive,
rather from &#383;lowne&#383;s of comprehen&#383;ion
than melancholy, it &#383;eemed to ab&#383;orb
the light of knowledge, to drink it in
ray by ray; nay, a new one was not
allowed to enter his head till the la&#383;t
was arranged: an opinion was thus
cautiou&#383;ly received, and maturely
weighed, before it was added to the
general &#383;tock. As nature led him to
mount from a part to the whole, he
was mo&#383;t conver&#383;ant with the beautiful,
and rarely comprehended the &#383;ublime;
yet, &#383;aid Sage&#383;tus, with a &#383;oftened tone,
he was all heart, full of forbearance, and
de&#383;irous to plea&#383;e every fellow-creature;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-120_S" id="Pg_4-120_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-120.png">120</a>]</span>
but from a nobler motive than a love
of admiration; the fumes of vanity
never mounted to cloud his brain, or
tarni&#383;h his beneficence. The fluid in
which tho&#383;e placid eyes &#383;wam, is now
congealed; how often has tenderne&#383;s
given them the fine&#383;t water! Some
torn parts of the child's dre&#383;s hung
round his arm, which led the &#383;age to
conclude, that he had &#383;aved the child;
every line in his face confirmed the
conjecture; benevolence indeed &#383;trung
the nerves that naturally were not
very firm; it was the great knot that
tied together the &#383;cattered qualities,
and gave the di&#383;tinct &#383;tamp to the character.</p>

<p>The female whom he next approached,
and &#383;uppo&#383;ed to be an attendant on
the other, was below the middle &#383;ize,
and her legs were &#383;o di&#383;proportionably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-121_S" id="Pg_4-121_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-121.png">121</a>]</span>
&#383;hort, that, when &#383;he moved, &#383;he mu&#383;t
have waddled along; her elbows were
drawn in to touch her long taper, wai&#383;t,
and the air of her whole body was an
affectation of gentility. Death could
not alter the rigid hang of her limbs, or
efface the &#383;imper that had &#383;tretched her
mouth; the lips were thin, as if nature
intended &#383;he &#383;hould mince her words;
her no&#383;e was &#383;mall, and &#383;harp at the
end; and the forehead, unmarked by
eyebrows, was wrinkled by the di&#383;content
that had &#383;unk her cheeks, on
which Sage&#383;tus &#383;till di&#383;cerned faint
traces of tenderne&#383;s; and fierce good-nature,
he perceived had &#383;ometimes
animated the little &#383;park of an eye that
anger had oftener lighted. The &#383;ame
thought occurred to him that the &#383;ight
of the &#383;ailors had &#383;ugge&#383;ted, Men and
women are all in their proper places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-122_S" id="Pg_4-122_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-122.png">122</a>]</span>&mdash;this
female was intended to fold up
linen and nur&#383;e the &#383;ick.</p>

<p>Anxious to ob&#383;erve the mother of
his charge, he turned to the lily that
had been &#383;o rudely &#383;napped, and, carefully
ob&#383;erving it, traced every fine line
to its &#383;ource. There was a delicacy in
her form, &#383;o truly feminine, that an involuntary
de&#383;ire to cheri&#383;h &#383;uch a being,
made the &#383;age again feel the almo&#383;t forgotten
&#383;en&#383;ations of his nature. On
ob&#383;erving her more clo&#383;ely, he di&#383;covered
that her natural delicacy had been
increa&#383;ed by an improper education,
to a degree that took away all vigour
from her faculties. And its baneful
influence had had &#383;uch an effect on her
mind, that few traces of the exertions
of it appeared on her face, though the
fine fini&#383;h of her features, and particularly
the form of the forehead, con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-123_S" id="Pg_4-123_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-123.png">123</a>]</span>vinced
the &#383;age that her under&#383;tanding
might have ri&#383;en con&#383;iderably above
mediocrity, had the wheels ever been
put in motion; but, clogged by prejudices,
they never turned quite round,
and, whenever &#383;he con&#383;idered a &#383;ubject,
&#383;he &#383;topped before &#383;he came to a conclu&#383;ion.
A&#383;&#383;uming a ma&#383;k of propriety,
&#383;he had bani&#383;hed nature; yet
its tendency was only to be diverted,
not &#383;tifled. Some lines, which took
from the &#383;ymmetry of the mouth, not
very obvious to a &#383;uperficial ob&#383;erver,
&#383;truck Sage&#383;tus, and they appeared to
him characters of indolent ob&#383;tinacy.
Not having courage to form an opinion
of her own, &#383;he adhered, with blind
partiality, to tho&#383;e &#383;he adopted, which
&#383;he received in the lump, and, as they
always remained unopened, of cour&#383;e
&#383;he only &#383;aw the even glo&#383;s on the out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-124_S" id="Pg_4-124_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-124.png">124</a>]</span>&#383;ide.
Ve&#383;tiges of anger were vi&#383;ible on
her brow, and the &#383;age concluded, that
&#383;he had often been offended with, and
indeed would &#383;carcely make any allowance
for, tho&#383;e who did not coincide
with her in opinion, as things always
appear &#383;elf-evident that have never
been examined; yet her very weakne&#383;s
gave a charming timidity to her countenance;
goodne&#383;s and tenderne&#383;s pervaded
every lineament, and melted in
her dark blue eyes. The compa&#383;&#383;ion
that wanted activity, was &#383;incere, though
it only embelli&#383;hed her face, or produced
ca&#383;ual acts of charity when a
moderate alms could relieve pre&#383;ent
di&#383;tre&#383;s. Unacquainted with life, fictitious,
unnatural di&#383;tre&#383;s drew the tears
that were not &#383;hed for real mi&#383;ery. In
its own &#383;hape, human wretchedne&#383;s
excites a little di&#383;gu&#383;t in the mind that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-125_S" id="Pg_4-125_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-125.png">125</a>]</span>
has indulged &#383;ickly refinement. Perhaps
the &#383;age gave way to a little conjecture
in drawing the la&#383;t conclu&#383;ion;
but his conjectures generally aro&#383;e from
di&#383;tinct ideas, and a dawn of light
allowed him to &#383;ee a great way farther
than common mortals.</p>

<p>He was now convinced that the orphan
was not very unfortunate in having
lo&#383;t &#383;uch a mother. The parent that
in&#383;pires fond affection without re&#383;pect,
is &#383;eldom an u&#383;eful one; and they only
are re&#383;pectable, who con&#383;ider right and
wrong ab&#383;tracted from local forms and
accidental modifications.</p>

<p>Determined to adopt the child, he
named it after him&#383;elf, Sage&#383;ta, and
retired to the hut where the innocent
&#383;lept, to think of the be&#383;t method of
educating this child, whom the angry
deep had &#383;pared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A form</span> now approached that
particularly &#383;truck and intere&#383;ted Sage&#383;ta.
The &#383;age, ob&#383;erving what pa&#383;&#383;ed in her
mind, bade her ever tru&#383;t to the fir&#383;t
impre&#383;&#383;ion. In life, he continued, try
to remember the effect the fir&#383;t appearance
of a &#383;tranger has on your mind;
and, in proportion to your &#383;en&#383;ibility,
you may decide on the character. Intelligence
glances from eyes that have
the &#383;ame pur&#383;uits, and a benevolent
heart &#383;oon traces the marks of benevolence
on the countenance of an unknown
fellow-creature; and not only
the countenance, but the ge&#383;tures, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-128_S" id="Pg_4-128_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-128.png">128</a>]</span>
voice, loudly &#383;peak truth to the unprejudiced
mind.</p>

<p>Whenever a &#383;tranger advances towards
you with a tripping &#383;tep, receives
you with broad &#383;miles, and a profu&#383;ion
of compliments, and yet you find your&#383;elf
embarra&#383;&#383;ed and unable to return
the &#383;alutation with equal cordiality, be
a&#383;&#383;ured that &#383;uch a per&#383;on is affected,
and endeavours to maintain a very good
character in the eyes of the world,
without really practi&#383;ing the &#383;ocial virtues
which dre&#383;s the face in looks of
unfeigned complacency. Kindred minds
are drawn to each other by expre&#383;&#383;ions
which elude de&#383;cription; and, like the
calm breeze that plays on a &#383;mooth
lake, they are rather felt than &#383;een.
Beware of a man who always appears in
good humour; a &#383;elfi&#383;h de&#383;ign too frequently
lurks in the &#383;miles the heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-129_S" id="Pg_4-129_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-129.png">129</a>]</span>
never curved; or there is an affectation
of candour that de&#383;troys all &#383;trength of
character, by blending truth and fal&#383;hood
into an unmeaning ma&#383;s. The
mouth, in fact, &#383;eems to be the feature
where you may trace every kind of di&#383;&#383;imulation,
from the &#383;imper of vanity,
to the fixed &#383;mile of the de&#383;igning villain.
Perhaps, the modulations of
the voice will &#383;till more quickly give
a key to the character than even the
turns of the mouth, or the words
that i&#383;&#383;ue from it; often do the
tones of unpracti&#383;ed di&#383;&#383;emblers give
the lie to their a&#383;&#383;ertions. Many
people never &#383;peak in an unnatural
voice, but when they are in&#383;incere: the
phra&#383;es not corre&#383;ponding with the
dictates of the heart, have nothing to
keep them in tune. In the cour&#383;e of
an argument however, you may ea&#383;ily
di&#383;cover whether vanity or conviction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-130_S" id="Pg_4-130_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-130.png">130</a>]</span>

inflated countenance may be turned
from you, and you may not &#383;ee the
ge&#383;tures which mark &#383;elf-&#383;ufficiency.
He &#383;topped, and the &#383;pirit began.</p>

<p>I have wandered through the cave;
and, as &#383;oon as I have taught you a u&#383;eful
le&#383;&#383;on, I &#383;hall take my flight where
my tears will cea&#383;e to flow, and where
mine eyes will no more be &#383;hocked
with the &#383;ight of guilt and &#383;orrow.
Before many moons have changed,
thou wilt enter, O mortal! into that
world I have lately left. Li&#383;ten to my
warning voice, and tru&#383;t not too much

phy&#383;ical. But my hi&#383;tory will afford you
more in&#383;truction than mere advice. Sage&#383;tus
concurred in opinion with her,
ob&#383;erving that the &#383;en&#383;es of children
&#383;hould be the fir&#383;t object of improvement;
then their pa&#383;&#383;ions worked on; and judgment
the fruit, mu&#383;t be the acquirement
of the being it&#383;elf, when out of
leading-&#383;trings. The &#383;pirit bowed a&#383;&#383;ent,
and, without any further prelude,
entered on her hi&#383;tory.</p>

<p>My mother was a mo&#383;t re&#383;pectable
character, but &#383;he was yoked to a man
who&#383;e follies and vices made her ever
feel the weight of her chains. The
fir&#383;t &#383;en&#383;ation I recollect, was pity; for
I have &#383;een her weep over me and the
re&#383;t of her babes, lamenting that the
extravagance of a father would throw
us de&#383;titute on the world. But, though
my father was extravagant, and &#383;eldom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-132_S" id="Pg_4-132_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-132.png">132</a>]</span>
thought of any thing but his own plea&#383;ures,
our education was not neglected.
In &#383;olitude, this employment was my
mother's only &#383;olace; and my father's
pride made him procure us ma&#383;ters;
nay, &#383;ometimes he was &#383;o gratified by
our improvement, that he would embrace
us with tenderne&#383;s, and intreat
my mother to forgive him, with marks
of real contrition. But the affection his
penitence gave ri&#383;e to, only &#383;erved to
expo&#383;e her to continual di&#383;appointments,
and keep hope alive merely to
torment her. After a violent debauch
he would let his beard grow, and the
&#383;adne&#383;s that reigned in the hou&#383;e I &#383;hall
never forget; he was a&#383;hamed to meet
even the eyes of his children. This is &#383;o
contrary to the nature of things, it
gave me exqui&#383;ite pain; I u&#383;ed, at tho&#383;e
times, to &#383;how him extreme re&#383;pect. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-133_S" id="Pg_4-133_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-133.png">133</a>]</span>
could not bear to &#383;ee my parent humble
him&#383;elf before me. However neither
his con&#383;titution, nor fortune could
long bear the con&#383;tant wa&#383;te. He had,
I have ob&#383;erved, a childi&#383;h affection
for his children, which was di&#383;played
in care&#383;&#383;es that gratified him for the
moment, yet never re&#383;trained the headlong
fury of his appetites; his momentary
repentance wrung his heart, without
influencing his conduct; and he died,
leaving an encumbered wreck of a good
e&#383;tate.</p>

<p>As we had always lived in &#383;plendid
poverty, rather than in affluence, the
&#383;hock was not &#383;o great; and my mother
repre&#383;&#383;ed her angui&#383;h, and concealed
&#383;ome circum&#383;tances, that &#383;he might not
&#383;hed a de&#383;tructive mildew over the
gaiety of youth.</p>

<p>So fondly did I doat on this dear pa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-134_S" id="Pg_4-134_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-134.png">134</a>]</span>rent,
that &#383;he engro&#383;&#383;ed all my tenderne&#383;s;
her &#383;orrows had knit me firmly to
her, and my chief care was to give her
proofs of affection. The gallantry that
afforded my companions, the few young
people my mother forced me to mix
with, &#383;o much plea&#383;ure, I de&#383;pi&#383;ed; I
wi&#383;hed more to be loved than admired,
for I could love. I adored virtue; and
my imagination, cha&#383;ing a chimerical
object, overlooked the common plea&#383;ures
of life; they were not &#383;ufficient for my
happine&#383;s. A latent fire made me burn
to ri&#383;e &#383;uperior to my contemporaries in
wi&#383;dom and virtue; and tears of joy
and emulation filled my eyes when I
read an account of a great action&mdash;I
felt admiration, not a&#383;toni&#383;hment.</p>

<p>My mother had two particular friends,
who endeavoured to &#383;ettle her affairs;
one was a middle-aged man, a mer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-135_S" id="Pg_4-135_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-135.png">135</a>]</span>chant;
the human brea&#383;t never en&#383;hrined
a more benevolent heart. His
manners were rather rough, and he
bluntly &#383;poke his thoughts without ob&#383;erving
the pain it gave; yet he po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed
extreme tenderne&#383;s, as far as his di&#383;cernment
went. Men do not make
&#383;ufficient di&#383;tinction, &#383;aid &#383;he, digre&#383;&#383;ing
from her &#383;tory to addre&#383;s Sage&#383;tus, between
tenderne&#383;s and &#383;en&#383;ibility.</p>

<p>To give the &#383;horte&#383;t definition of &#383;en&#383;ibility,
replied the &#383;age, I &#383;hould &#383;ay
that it is the re&#383;ult of acute &#383;en&#383;es, finely
fa&#383;hioned nerves, which vibrate at the
&#383;lighte&#383;t touch, and convey &#383;uch clear intelligence
to the brain, that it does not
require to be arranged by the judgment.
Such per&#383;ons in&#383;tantly enter into the
characters of others, and in&#383;tinctively
di&#383;cern what will give pain to every
human being; their own feelings are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-136_S" id="Pg_4-136_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-136.png">136</a>]</span>
&#383;o varied that they &#383;eem to contain in
them&#383;elves, not only all the pa&#383;&#383;ions of the
&#383;pecies, but their various modifications.
Exqui&#383;ite pain and plea&#383;ure is their
portion; nature wears for them a different
a&#383;pect than is di&#383;played to common
mortals. One moment it is a paradi&#383;e;
all is beautiful: a cloud ari&#383;es, an emotion
receives a &#383;udden damp; darkne&#383;s
invades the &#383;ky, and the world is an
unweeded garden;&mdash;but go on with
your narrative, &#383;aid Sage&#383;tus, recollecting
him&#383;elf.</p>

<p>She proceeded. The man I am de&#383;cribing
was humanity it&#383;elf; but frequently
he did not under&#383;tand me; many of my
feelings were not to be analyzed by
his common &#383;en&#383;e. His friend&#383;hips,
for he had many friends, gave him plea&#383;ure
unmixed with pain; his religion
was coldly rea&#383;onable, becau&#383;e he want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-137_S" id="Pg_4-137_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-137.png">137</a>]</span>ed
fancy, and he did not feel the nece&#383;&#383;ity
of finding, or creating, a perfect
object, to an&#383;wer the one engraved on
his heart: the &#383;ketch there was faint.
He went with the &#383;tream, and rather
caught a character from the &#383;ociety he
lived in, than &#383;pread one around him.
In my mind many opinions were graven
with a pen of bra&#383;s, which he thought
chimerical: but time could not era&#383;e
them, and I now recognize them as
the &#383;eeds of eternal happine&#383;s: they
will &#383;oon expand in tho&#383;e realms where
I &#383;hall enjoy the bli&#383;s adapted to my
nature; this is all we need a&#383;k of the
Supreme Being; happine&#383;s mu&#383;t follow
the completion of his de&#383;igns. He
however could live quietly, without
giving a preponderancy to many important
opinions that continually obtruded
on my mind; not having an en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-138_S" id="Pg_4-138_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-138.png">138</a>]</span>thu&#383;ia&#383;tic
affection for his fellow creatures,
he did them good, without &#383;uffering
from their follies. He was particularly
attached to me, and I felt for
him all the affection of a daughter;
often, when he had been intere&#383;ting
him&#383;elf to promote my welfare, have I
lamented that he was not my father;
lamented that the vices of mine had
dried up one &#383;ource of pure affection.</p>

<p>The other friend I have already alluded
to, was of a very different character;
greatne&#383;s of mind, and tho&#383;e
combinations of feeling which are &#383;o
difficult to de&#383;cribe, rai&#383;ed him above
the throng, that bu&#383;tle their hour out,
lie down to &#383;leep, and are forgotten.
But I &#383;hall &#383;oon &#383;ee him, &#383;he exclaimed,
as much &#383;uperior to his former &#383;elf, as
he then ro&#383;e in my eyes above his fellow
creatures! As &#383;he &#383;poke, a glow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-139_S" id="Pg_4-139_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-139.png">139</a>]</span>
of delight animated each feature; her
countenance appeared tran&#383;parent; and
&#383;he &#383;ilently anticipated the happine&#383;s
&#383;he &#383;hould enjoy, when &#383;he entered tho&#383;e
man&#383;ions, where death-divided friends
&#383;hould meet, to part no more; where
human weakne&#383;s could not damp their
bli&#383;s, or poi&#383;on the cup of joy that, on
earth, drops from the lips as &#383;oon as
ta&#383;ted, or, if &#383;ome daring mortal &#383;natches
a ha&#383;ty draught, what was &#383;weet to the
ta&#383;te becomes a root of bitterne&#383;s.</p>

<p>He was unfortunate, had many cares
to &#383;truggle with, and I marked on his
cheeks traces of the &#383;ame &#383;orrows that
&#383;unk my own. He was unhappy I &#383;ay,
and perhaps pity might fir&#383;t have awoke
my tenderne&#383;s; for, early in life, an
artful woman worked on his compa&#383;&#383;ionate
&#383;oul, and he united his fate to
a being made up of &#383;uch jarring ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-140_S" id="Pg_4-140_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-140.png">140</a>]</span>ments,
that he was &#383;till alone. The
di&#383;covery did not extingui&#383;h that propen&#383;ity
to love, a high &#383;en&#383;e of virtue
fed. I &#383;aw him &#383;ick and unhappy,
without a friend to &#383;ooth the hours
languor made heavy; often did I &#383;it a
long winter's evening by his &#383;ide, railing
at the &#383;wift wings of time, and
terming my love, humanity.</p>

<p>Two years pa&#383;&#383;ed in this manner, &#383;ilently
rooting my affection; and it might
have continued calm, if a fever had
not brought him to the very verge of
the grave. Though &#383;till deceived, I was
mi&#383;erable that the cu&#383;toms of the world
did not allow me to watch by him;
when &#383;leep for&#383;ook his pillow, my wearied
eyes were not clo&#383;ed, and my
anxious &#383;pirit hovered round his bed.
I &#383;aw him, before he had recovered his
&#383;trength; and, when his hand touched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-141_S" id="Pg_4-141_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-141.png">141</a>]</span>
mine, life almo&#383;t retired, or flew to
meet the touch. The fir&#383;t look found
a ready way to my heart, and thrilled
through every vein. We were left
alone, and in&#383;en&#383;ibly began to talk of
the immortality of the &#383;oul; I declared
that I could not live without this conviction.
In the ardour of conver&#383;ation
he pre&#383;&#383;ed my hand to his heart; it
re&#383;ted there a moment, and my emotions
gave weight to my opinion, for
the affection we felt was not of a peri&#383;hable
nature.&mdash;A &#383;ilence en&#383;ued, I
know not how long; he then threw
my hand from him, as if it had been a
&#383;erpent; formally complained of the
weather, and adverted to twenty other
unintere&#383;ting &#383;ubjects. Vain efforts!
Our hearts had already &#383;poken to
each other.</p>

<p>Feebly did I afterwards combat an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-142_S" id="Pg_4-142_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-142.png">142</a>]</span>
affection, which &#383;eemed twi&#383;ted in every
fibre of my heart. The world &#383;tood &#383;till
when I thought of him; it moved heavily
at be&#383;t, with one who&#383;e very con&#383;titution
&#383;eemed to mark her out for mi&#383;ery.
But I will not dwell on the pa&#383;&#383;ion
I too fondly nur&#383;ed. One only refuge
had I on earth; I could not re&#383;olutely
de&#383;olate the &#383;cene my fancy flew to,
when worldly cares, when a knowledge
of mankind, which my circum&#383;tances
forced on me, rendered every other
in&#383;ipid. I was afraid of the unmarked
vacuity of common life; yet, though I
&#383;upinely indulged my&#383;elf in fairy-land,
when I ought to have been more actively
employed, virtue was &#383;till the
fir&#383;t mover of my actions; &#383;he dre&#383;&#383;ed
my love in &#383;uch enchanting colours,
and &#383;pread the net I could never break.
Our corre&#383;ponding feelings confounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-143_S" id="Pg_4-143_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-143.png">143</a>]</span>
our very &#383;ouls; and in many conver&#383;ations
we almo&#383;t intuitively di&#383;cerned
each other's &#383;entiments; the heart opened
it&#383;elf, not chilled by re&#383;erve, nor
afraid of mi&#383;con&#383;truction. But, if virtue
in&#383;pired love, love gave new energy to
virtue, and ab&#383;orbed every &#383;elfi&#383;h pa&#383;&#383;ion.
Never did even a wi&#383;h e&#383;cape
me, that my lover &#383;hould not fulfil the
hard duties which fate had impo&#383;ed on
him. I only di&#383;&#383;embled with him in
one particular; I endeavoured to &#383;often
his wife's too con&#383;picuous follies, and
extenuated her failings in an indirect
manner. To this I was prompted by a
loftine&#383;s of &#383;pirit; I &#383;hould have broken
the band of life, had I cea&#383;ed to re&#383;pect
my&#383;elf. But I will ha&#383;ten to an important
change in my circum&#383;tances.</p>

<p>My mother, who had concealed the
real &#383;tate of her affairs from me, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-144_S" id="Pg_4-144_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-144.png">144</a>]</span>
now impelled to make me her confident,
that I might a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t to di&#383;charge
her mighty debt of gratitude. The
merchant, my more than father, had
privately a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted her: but a fatal civil-war
reduced his large property to a
bare competency; and an inflammation
in his eyes, that aro&#383;e from a cold he
had caught at a wreck, which he watched
during a &#383;tormy night to keep off
the lawle&#383;s colliers, almo&#383;t deprived
him of &#383;ight. His life had been &#383;pent
in &#383;ociety, and he &#383;carcely knew how
to fill the void; for his &#383;pirit would not
allow him to mix with his former
equals as an humble companion; he
who had been treated with uncommon
re&#383;pect, could not brook their in&#383;ulting
pity. From the re&#383;ource of &#383;olitude,
reading, the complaint in his eyes cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-145_S" id="Pg_4-145_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-145.png">145</a>]</span>
him off, and he became our con&#383;tant
vi&#383;itor.</p>

<p>Actuated by the &#383;incere&#383;t affection,
I u&#383;ed to read to him, and he mi&#383;took
my tenderne&#383;s for love. How could I
undeceive him, when every circum&#383;tance
frowned on him! Too &#383;oon I
found that I was his only comfort; I,
who rejected his hand when fortune
&#383;miled, could not now &#383;econd her blow;
and, in a moment of enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic gratitude
and tender compa&#383;&#383;ion, I offered
him my hand.&mdash;It was received with
plea&#383;ure; tran&#383;port was not made for
his &#383;oul; nor did he di&#383;cover that nature
had &#383;eparated us, by making me
alive to &#383;uch different &#383;en&#383;ations. My
mother was to live with us, and I
dwelt on this circum&#383;tance to bani&#383;h
cruel recollections, when the bent bow
returned to its former &#383;tate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-146_S" id="Pg_4-146_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-146.png">146</a>]</span>
With a bur&#383;ting heart and a firm
voice, I named the day when I was to
&#383;eal my promi&#383;e. It came, in &#383;pite of
my regret; I had been previou&#383;ly preparing
my&#383;elf for the awful ceremony,
and an&#383;wered the &#383;olemn que&#383;tion with
a re&#383;olute tone, that would &#383;ilence the
dictates of my heart; it was a forced,
unvaried one; had nature modulated
it, my &#383;ecret would have e&#383;caped. My
active &#383;pirit was painfully on the watch
to repre&#383;s every tender emotion. The
joy in my venerable parent's countenance,
the tenderne&#383;s of my hu&#383;band,
as he conducted me home, for I really
had a &#383;incere affection for him, the gratulations
of my mind, when I thought
that this &#383;acrifice was heroic, all tended
to deceive me; but the joy of victory
over the re&#383;igned, pallid look of my
lover, haunted my imagination, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-147_S" id="Pg_4-147_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-147.png">147</a>]</span>
fixed it&#383;elf in the centre of my brain.&mdash;Still
I imagined, that his &#383;pirit was near
me, that he only felt &#383;orrow for my
lo&#383;s, and without complaint re&#383;igned
me to my duty.</p>

<p>I was left alone a moment; my two
elbows re&#383;ted on a table to &#383;upport my
chin. Ten thou&#383;and thoughts darted
with a&#383;toni&#383;hing velocity through my
mind. My eyes were dry; I was on the
brink of madne&#383;s. At this moment a
&#383;trange a&#383;&#383;ociation was made by my
imagination; I thought of Gallileo, who
when he left the inqui&#383;ition, looked
upwards, and cried out, "Yet it moves."
A &#383;hower of tears, like the refre&#383;hing
drops of heaven, relieved my parched
&#383;ockets; they fell di&#383;regarded on the
table; and, &#383;tamping with my foot, in an
agony I exclaimed, "Yet I love." My
hu&#383;band entered before I had calmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-148_S" id="Pg_4-148_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-148.png">148</a>]</span>
the&#383;e tumultuous emotions, and tenderly
took my hand. I &#383;natched it from
him; grief and &#383;urpri&#383;e were marked
on his countenance; I ha&#383;tily &#383;tretched
it out again. My heart &#383;mote me, and I
removed the tran&#383;ient mi&#383;t by an unfeigned
endeavour to plea&#383;e him.</p>

<p>A few months after, my mind grew
calmer; and, if a treacherous imagination,
if feelings many accidents revived,
&#383;ometimes plunged me into melancholy,
I often repeated with &#383;teady
conviction, that virtue was not an
empty name, and that, in following the
dictates of duty, I had not bidden adieu
to content.</p>

<p>In the cour&#383;e of a few years, the
dear object of my fonde&#383;t affection,
&#383;aid farewel, in dying accents. Thus
left alone, my grief became dear; and I
did not feel &#383;olitary, becau&#383;e I thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-149_S" id="Pg_4-149_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-149.png">149</a>]</span>
I might, without a crime, indulge a
pa&#383;&#383;ion, that grew more ardent than ever
when my imagination only pre&#383;ented
him to my view, and re&#383;tored my former
activity of &#383;oul which the late
calm had rendered torpid. I &#383;eemed to
find my&#383;elf again, to find the eccentric
warmth that gave me identity of character.
Rea&#383;on had governed my conduct,
but could not change my nature;
this voluptuous &#383;orrow was &#383;uperior to
every gratification of &#383;en&#383;e, and death
more firmly united our hearts.</p>

<p>Alive to every human affection, I
&#383;moothed my mothers pa&#383;&#383;age to eternity,
and &#383;o often gave my hu&#383;band
&#383;incere proofs of affection, he never
&#383;uppo&#383;ed that I was actuated by a more
fervent attachment. My melancholy,
my uneven &#383;pirits, he attributed to my
extreme &#383;en&#383;ibility, and loved me the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-150_S" id="Pg_4-150_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-150.png">150</a>]</span>
better for po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing qualities he could
not comprehend.</p>

<p>At the clo&#383;e of a &#383;ummer's day, &#383;ome
years after, I wandered with carele&#383;s
&#383;teps over a pathle&#383;s common; various
anxieties had rendered the hours which
the &#383;un had enlightened heavy; &#383;ober
evening came on; I wi&#383;hed to &#383;till "my
mind, and woo lone quiet in her &#383;ilent
walk." The &#383;cene accorded with my
feelings; it was wild and grand; and
the &#383;preading twilight had almo&#383;t confounded
the di&#383;tant &#383;ea with the barren,
blue hills that melted from my &#383;ight.
I &#383;at down on a ri&#383;ing ground; the rays
of the departing &#383;un illumined the horizon,
but &#383;o indi&#383;tinctly, that I anticipated
their total extinction. The
death of Nature led me to a &#383;till more
intere&#383;ting &#383;ubject, that came home to
my bo&#383;om, the death of him I loved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-151_S" id="Pg_4-151_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-151.png">151</a>]</span>
A village-bell was tolling; I li&#383;tened,
and thought of the moment when I
heard his interrupted breath, and felt
the agonizing fear, that the &#383;ame &#383;ound
would never more reach my ears, and
that the intelligence glanced from my
eyes, would no more be felt. The
&#383;poiler had &#383;eized his prey; the &#383;un
was fled, what was this world to me!
I wandered to another, where death
and darkne&#383;s could not enter; I pur&#383;ued
the &#383;un beyond the mountains,
and the &#383;oul e&#383;caped from this vale of
tears. My reflections were tinged with
melancholy, but they were &#383;ublime.&mdash;I
gra&#383;ped a mighty whole, and &#383;miled
on the king of terrors; the tie which
bound me to my friends he could not
break; the &#383;ame my&#383;terious knot united
me to the &#383;ource of all goodne&#383;s and
happine&#383;s. I had &#383;een the divinity re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-152_S" id="Pg_4-152_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-152.png">152</a>]</span>flected
in a face I loved; I had read
immortal characters di&#383;played on a
human countenance, and forgot my&#383;elf
whil&#383;t I gazed. I could not think of
immortality, without recollecting the
ec&#383;tacy I felt, when my heart fir&#383;t whi&#383;pered
to me that I was beloved; and
again did I feel the &#383;acred tie of mutual
affection; fervently I prayed to the father
of mercies; and rejoiced that he
could &#383;ee every turn of a heart, who&#383;e
movements I could not perfectly under&#383;tand.
My pa&#383;&#383;ion &#383;eemed a pledge
of immortality; I did not wi&#383;h to hide
it from the all-&#383;earching eye of heaven.
Where indeed could I go from his pre&#383;ence?
and, whil&#383;t it was dear to me,
though darkne&#383;s might reign during
the night of life, joy would come when
I awoke to life everla&#383;ting.</p>

<p>I now turned my &#383;tep towards home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-153_S" id="Pg_4-153_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-153.png">153</a>]</span>
when the appearance of a girl, who
&#383;tood weeping on the common, attracted
my attention. I acco&#383;ted her,
and &#383;oon heard her &#383;imple tale; that her
father was gone to &#383;ea, and her mother
&#383;ick in bed. I followed her to their
little dwelling, and relieved the &#383;ick
wretch. I then again &#383;ought my own
abode; but death did not now haunt
my fancy. Contriving to give the poor
creature I had left more effectual relief,
I reached my own garden-gate very
weary, and re&#383;ted on it.&mdash;Recollecting
the turns of my mind during the walk,
I exclaimed, Surely life may thus be
enlivened by active benevolence, and
the &#383;leep of death, like that I am now
di&#383;po&#383;ed to fall into, may be &#383;weet!</p>

<p>My life was now unmarked by any
extraordinary change, and a few days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-154_S" id="Pg_4-154_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-154.png">154</a>]</span>
ago I entered this cavern; for through
it every mortal mu&#383;t pa&#383;s; and here I
have di&#383;covered, that I neglected many
opportunities of being u&#383;eful, whil&#383;t I
fo&#383;tered a devouring flame. Remor&#383;e
has not reached me, becau&#383;e I firmly
adhered to my principles, and I have
al&#383;o di&#383;covered that I &#383;aw through a
fal&#383;e medium. Worthy as the mortal
was I adored, I &#383;hould not long have
loved him with the ardour I did, had
fate united us, and broken the delu&#383;ion
the imagination &#383;o artfully wove. His
virtues, as they now do, would have
extorted my e&#383;teem; but he who formed
the human &#383;oul, only can fill it, and the
chief happine&#383;s of an immortal being
mu&#383;t ari&#383;e from the &#383;ame &#383;ource as its
exi&#383;tence. Earthly love leads to heavenly,
and prepares us for a more ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-155_S" id="Pg_4-155_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-155.png">155</a>]</span>alted

nature, and de&#383;troy it&#383;elf, by trampling
on the virtue, that con&#383;titutes its e&#383;&#383;ence,
and allies us to the Deity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A ta&#383;te</span> for rural &#383;cenes, in the
pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of &#383;ociety, appears to be
very often an artificial &#383;entiment, rather
in&#383;pired by poetry and romances,
than a real perception of the beauties
of nature. But, as it is reckoned a
proof of refined ta&#383;te to prai&#383;e the calm
plea&#383;ures which the country affords, the
theme is never exhau&#383;ted. Yet it may
be made a que&#383;tion, whether this ro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-160_S" id="Pg_4-160_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-160.png">160</a>]</span>mantic
kind of declamation, has much
effect on the conduct of tho&#383;e, who
leave, for a &#383;ea&#383;on, the crowded cities
in which they were bred.</p>

<p>I have been led to the&#383;e reflections,
by ob&#383;erving, when I have re&#383;ided for
any length of time in the country, how
few people &#383;eem to contemplate nature
with their own eyes. I have "bru&#383;hed
the dew away" in the morning; but,
pacing over the printle&#383;s gra&#383;s, I have
wondered that, in &#383;uch delightful &#383;ituations,
the &#383;un was allowed to ri&#383;e in
&#383;olitary maje&#383;ty, whil&#383;t my eyes alone
hailed its beautifying beams. The
webs of the evening have &#383;till been
&#383;pread acro&#383;s the hedged path, unle&#383;s
&#383;ome labouring man, trudging to work,
di&#383;turbed the fairy &#383;tructure; yet, in
&#383;pite of this &#383;upinene&#383;s, when I joined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-161_S" id="Pg_4-161_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-161.png">161</a>]</span>
the &#383;ocial circle, every tongue rang
changes on the plea&#383;ures of the country.</p>

<p>Having frequently had occa&#383;ion to
make the &#383;ame ob&#383;ervation, I was led to
endeavour, in one of my &#383;olitary rambles,
to trace the cau&#383;e, and likewi&#383;e
to enquire why the poetry written in
the infancy of &#383;ociety, is mo&#383;t natural:
which, &#383;trictly &#383;peaking (for <i>natural</i>
is a very indefinite expre&#383;&#383;ion) is merely
to &#383;ay, that it is the tran&#383;cript of immediate
&#383;en&#383;ations, in all their native
wildne&#383;s and &#383;implicity, when fancy,
awakened by the &#383;ight of intere&#383;ting
objects, was mo&#383;t actively at work.
At &#383;uch moments, &#383;en&#383;ibility quickly
furni&#383;hes &#383;imiles, and the &#383;ublimated
&#383;pirits combine images, which ri&#383;ing
&#383;pontaneou&#383;ly, it is not nece&#383;&#383;ary coldly
to ran&#383;ack the under&#383;tanding or memory,
till the laborious efforts of judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-162_S" id="Pg_4-162_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-162.png">162</a>]</span>ment
exclude pre&#383;ent &#383;en&#383;ations, and
damp the fire of enthu&#383;ia&#383;m.</p>

<p>The effu&#383;ions of a vigorous mind, will
ever tell us how far the under&#383;tanding
has been enlarged by thought, and
&#383;tored with knowledge. The richne&#383;s
of the &#383;oil even appears on the &#383;urface;
and the re&#383;ult of profound thinking,
often mixing, with playful grace, in the
reveries of the poet, &#383;moothly incorporates
with the ebullitions of animal
&#383;pirits, when the finely fa&#383;hioned nerve
vibrates acutely with rapture, or when,
relaxed by &#383;oft melancholy, a plea&#383;ing
languor prompts the long-drawn &#383;igh,
and feeds the &#383;lowly falling tear.</p>

<p>The poet, the man of &#383;trong feelings,
gives us only an image of his mind,
when he was actually alone, conver&#383;ing
with him&#383;elf, and marking the impre&#383;&#383;ion
which nature had made on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-163_S" id="Pg_4-163_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-163.png">163</a>]</span>
own heart.&mdash;If, at this &#383;acred moment,
the idea of &#383;ome departed friend, &#383;ome
tender recollection when the &#383;oul was
mo&#383;t alive to tenderne&#383;s, intruded unawares
into his thoughts, the &#383;orrow
which it produced is artle&#383;&#383;ly, yet poetically
expre&#383;&#383;ed&mdash;and who can avoid
&#383;ympathizing?</p>

<p>Love to man leads to devotion&mdash;grand
and &#383;ublime images &#383;trike the
imagination&mdash;God is &#383;een in every
floating cloud, and comes from the
mi&#383;ty mountain to receive the noble&#383;t
homage of an intelligent creature&mdash;prai&#383;e.
How &#383;olemn is the moment,
when all affections and remembrances
fade before the &#383;ublime admiration
which the wi&#383;dom and goodne&#383;s of God
in&#383;pires, when he is wor&#383;hipped in a
<i>temple not made with hands</i>, and the
world &#383;eems to contain only the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-164_S" id="Pg_4-164_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-164.png">164</a>]</span>
that formed, and the mind that contemplates
it! The&#383;e are not the weak
re&#383;pon&#383;es of ceremonial devotion; nor,
to expre&#383;s them, would the poet need
another poet's aid: his heart burns
within him, and he &#383;peaks the language
of truth and nature with re&#383;i&#383;tle&#383;s
energy.</p>

<p>Inequalities, of cour&#383;e, are ob&#383;ervable
in his effu&#383;ions; and a le&#383;s vigorous
fancy, with more ta&#383;te, would
have produced more elegance and uniformity;
but, as pa&#383;&#383;ages are &#383;oftened
or expunged during the cooler moments
of reflection, the under&#383;tanding
is gratified at the expence of tho&#383;e involuntary
&#383;en&#383;ations, which, like the
beauteous tints of an evening &#383;ky, are
&#383;o evane&#383;cent, that they melt into new
forms before they can be analyzed. For
however eloquently we may boa&#383;t of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-165_S" id="Pg_4-165_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-165.png">165</a>]</span>
our rea&#383;on, man mu&#383;t often be delighted
he cannot tell why, or his blunt
feelings are not made to reli&#383;h the beauties
which nature, poetry, or any of
the imitative arts, afford.</p>

<p>The imagery of the ancients &#383;eems
naturally to have been borrowed from
&#383;urrounding objects and their mythology.
When a hero is to be tran&#383;ported
from one place to another, acro&#383;s
pathle&#383;s wa&#383;tes, is any vehicle &#383;o natural,
as one of the fleecy clouds on which
the poet has often gazed, &#383;carcely con&#383;cious
that he wi&#383;hed to make it his
chariot? Again, when nature &#383;eems
to pre&#383;ent ob&#383;tacles to his progre&#383;s at
almo&#383;t every &#383;tep, when the tangled
fore&#383;t and &#383;teep mountain &#383;tand as barriers,
to pa&#383;s over which the mind
longs for &#383;upernatural aid; an interpo&#383;ing
deity, who walks on the waves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-166_S" id="Pg_4-166_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-166.png">166</a>]</span>
and rules the &#383;torm, &#383;everely felt in the
fir&#383;t attempts to cultivate a country,
will receive from the impa&#383;&#383;ioned fancy
"a local habitation and a name."</p>

<p>It would be a philo&#383;ophical enquiry,
and throw &#383;ome light on the hi&#383;tory of
the human mind, to trace, as far as our
information will allow us to trace, the
&#383;pontaneous feelings and ideas which
have produced the images that now
frequently appear unnatural, becau&#383;e
they are remote; and di&#383;gu&#383;ting, becau&#383;e
they have been &#383;ervilely copied
by poets, who&#383;e habits of thinking,
and views of nature mu&#383;t have been
different; for, though the under&#383;tanding
&#383;eldom di&#383;turbs the current of our pre&#383;ent
feelings, without di&#383;&#383;ipating the
gay clouds which fancy has been embracing,
yet it &#383;ilently gives the colour
to the whole tenour of them, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-167_S" id="Pg_4-167_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-167.png">167</a>]</span>
dream is over, when truth is gro&#383;&#383;ly
violated, or images introduced, &#383;elected
from books, and not from local manners
or popular prejudices.</p>

<p>In a more advanced &#383;tate of civilization,
a poet is rather the creature of
art, than of nature. The books that he
reads in his youth, become a hot-bed
in which artificial fruits are produced,
beautiful to the common eye, though
they want the true hue and flavour.
His images do not ari&#383;e from &#383;en&#383;ations;
they are copies; and, like the works
of the painters who copy ancient &#383;tatues
when they draw men and women
of their own times, we acknowledge
that the features are fine, and the proportions
ju&#383;t; yet they are men of
&#383;tone; in&#383;ipid figures, that never convey
to the mind the idea of a portrait
taken from life, where the &#383;oul gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-168_S" id="Pg_4-168_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-168.png">168</a>]</span>
&#383;pirit and homogeneity to the whole.
The &#383;ilken wings of fancy are &#383;hrivelled
by rules; and a de&#383;ire of attaining
elegance of diction, occa&#383;ions an attention
to words, incompatible with
&#383;ublime, impa&#383;&#383;ioned thoughts.</p>

<p>A boy of abilities, who has been
taught the &#383;tructure of ver&#383;e at &#383;chool,
and been rou&#383;ed by emulation to compo&#383;e
rhymes whil&#383;t he was reading
works of genius, may, by practice,
produce pretty ver&#383;es, and even become
what is often termed an elegant
poet: yet his readers, without knowing
what to find fault with, do not
find them&#383;elves warmly intere&#383;ted. In
the works of the poets who fa&#383;ten on
their affections, they &#383;ee gro&#383;&#383;er faults,
and the very images which &#383;hock their
ta&#383;te in the modern; &#383;till they do not appear
as puerile or extrin&#383;ic in one as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-169_S" id="Pg_4-169_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-169.png">169</a>]</span>
other.&mdash;Why?&mdash;becau&#383;e they did not
appear &#383;o to the author.</p>

<p>It may &#383;ound paradoxical, after ob&#383;erving
that tho&#383;e productions want
vigour, that are merely the work of
imitation, in which the under&#383;tanding
has violently directed, if not extingui&#383;hed,
the blaze of fancy, to a&#383;&#383;ert, that,
though genius be only another word
for exqui&#383;ite &#383;en&#383;ibility, the fir&#383;t ob&#383;ervers
of nature, the true poets, exerci&#383;ed
their under&#383;tanding much more
than their imitators. But they exerci&#383;ed
it to di&#383;criminate things, whil&#383;t
their followers were bu&#383;y to borrow
&#383;entiments and arrange words.</p>

<p>Boys who have received a cla&#383;&#383;ical
education, load their memory with
words, and the corre&#383;pondent ideas
are perhaps never di&#383;tinctly comprehended.
As a proof of this a&#383;&#383;ertion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-170_S" id="Pg_4-170_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-170.png">170</a>]</span>
I mu&#383;t ob&#383;erve, that I have known
many young people who could write
tolerably &#383;mooth ver&#383;es, and &#383;tring epithets
prettily together, when their
pro&#383;e themes &#383;howed the barrenne&#383;s of
their minds, and how &#383;uperficial the
cultivation mu&#383;t have been, which
their under&#383;tanding had received.</p>

<p>Dr. John&#383;on, I know, has given a definition
of genius, which would overturn
my rea&#383;oning, if I were to admit
it.&mdash;He imagines, that <i>a &#383;trong mind,
accidentally led to &#383;ome particular &#383;tudy</i> in
which it excels, is a genius.&mdash;Not to
&#383;top to inve&#383;tigate the cau&#383;es which
produced this happy <i>&#383;trength</i> of mind,
experience &#383;eems to prove, that tho&#383;e
minds have appeared mo&#383;t vigorous,
that have pur&#383;ued a &#383;tudy, after nature
had di&#383;covered a bent; for it would be
ab&#383;urd to &#383;uppo&#383;e, that a &#383;light impre&#383;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-171_S" id="Pg_4-171_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-171.png">171</a>]</span>&#383;ion
made on the weak faculties of a
boy, is the fiat of fate, and not to be
effaced by any &#383;ucceeding impre&#383;&#383;ion,
or unexpected difficulty. Dr. John&#383;on
in fact, appears &#383;ometimes to be of the
&#383;ame opinion (how con&#383;i&#383;tently I &#383;hall
not now enquire), e&#383;pecially when he
ob&#383;erves, "that Thom&#383;on looked on
nature with the eye which &#383;he only
gives to a poet."</p>

<p>But, though it &#383;hould be allowed
that books may produce &#383;ome poets, I
fear they will never be the poets who
charm our cares to &#383;leep, or extort admiration.
They may diffu&#383;e ta&#383;te, and
poli&#383;h the language; but I am inclined
to conclude that they will &#383;eldom rou&#383;e
the pa&#383;&#383;ions, or amend the heart.</p>

<p>And, to return to the fir&#383;t &#383;ubject of
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion, the rea&#383;on why mo&#383;t people
are more intere&#383;ted by a &#383;cene de&#383;crib<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-172_S" id="Pg_4-172_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-172.png">172</a>]</span>ed
by a poet, than by a view of nature,
probably ari&#383;es from the want of a
lively imagination. The poet contracts
the pro&#383;pect, and, &#383;electing the mo&#383;t
picture&#383;que part in his <i>camera</i>, the judgment
is directed, and the whole force
of the languid faculty turned towards
the objects which excited the mo&#383;t
forcible emotions in the poet's heart;
the reader con&#383;equently feels the enlivened
de&#383;cription, though he was not
able to receive a fir&#383;t impre&#383;&#383;ion from
the operations of his own mind.</p>

<p>Be&#383;ides, it may be further ob&#383;erved,
that gro&#383;s minds are only to be moved
by forcible repre&#383;entations. To rou&#383;e
the thoughtle&#383;s, objects mu&#383;t be pre&#383;ented,
calculated to produce tumultuous
emotions; the un&#383;ub&#383;tantial, picture&#383;que
forms which a contemplative
man gazes on, and often follows with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-173_S" id="Pg_4-173_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-173.png">173</a>]</span>
ardour till he is mocked by a glimp&#383;e
of unattainable excellence, appear to
them the light vapours of a dreaming
enthu&#383;ia&#383;t, who gives up the &#383;ub&#383;tance
for the &#383;hadow. It is not within that
they &#383;eek amu&#383;ement; their eyes are
&#383;eldom turned on them&#383;elves; con&#383;equently
their emotions, though &#383;ometimes
fervid, are always tran&#383;ient, and
the nicer perceptions which di&#383;tingui&#383;h
the man of genuine ta&#383;te, are not felt,
or make &#383;uch a &#383;light impre&#383;&#383;ion as
&#383;carcely to excite any plea&#383;urable &#383;en&#383;ations.
Is it &#383;urpri&#383;ing then that they
are often overlooked, even by tho&#383;e
who are delighted by the &#383;ame images
concentrated by the poet?</p>

<p>But even this numerous cla&#383;s is exceeded,
by witlings, who, anxious
to appear to have wit and ta&#383;te, do
not allow their under&#383;tandings or feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-174_S" id="Pg_4-174_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-174.png">174</a>]</span>ings
any liberty; for, in&#383;tead of cultivating
their faculties and reflecting on
their operations, they are bu&#383;y collecting
prejudices; and are predetermined
to admire what the &#383;uffrage of time
announces as excellent, not to &#383;tore up
a fund of amu&#383;ement for them&#383;elves,
but to enable them to talk.</p>

<p>The&#383;e hints will a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t the reader to
trace &#383;ome of the cau&#383;es why the beauties
of nature are not forcibly felt,
when civilization, or rather luxury,
has made con&#383;iderable advances&mdash;tho&#383;e
calm &#383;en&#383;ations are not &#383;ufficiently
lively to &#383;erve as a relaxation to the voluptuary,
or even to the moderate pur&#383;uer
of artificial plea&#383;ures. In the pre&#383;ent
&#383;tate of &#383;ociety, the under&#383;tanding
mu&#383;t bring back the feelings to nature,
or the &#383;en&#383;ibility mu&#383;t have &#383;uch native
&#383;trength, as rather to be whetted than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-175_S" id="Pg_4-175_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-175.png">175</a>]</span>
de&#383;troyed by the &#383;trong exerci&#383;es of
pa&#383;&#383;ion.</p>

<p>That the mo&#383;t valuable things are liable
to the greate&#383;t perver&#383;ion, is however
as trite as true:&mdash;for the &#383;ame &#383;en&#383;ibility,
or quickne&#383;s of &#383;en&#383;es, which
makes a man reli&#383;h the tranquil &#383;cenes
of nature, when &#383;en&#383;ation, rather than
rea&#383;on, imparts delight, frequently makes
a libertine of him, by leading him to
prefer the &#383;en&#383;ual tumult of love a
little refined by &#383;entiment, to the calm
plea&#383;ures of affectionate friend&#383;hip, in
who&#383;e &#383;ober &#383;ati&#383;factions, rea&#383;on, mixing
her tranquillizing convictions, whi&#383;pers,
that content, not happine&#383;s, is the

<h2>HINTS.</h2>

<p class="center">1.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Indolence</span> is the &#383;ource of nervous
complaints, and a whole ho&#383;t of
cares. This devil might &#383;ay that his
name was legion.</p>

<p class="center">2.</p>
<p>It &#383;hould be one of the employments
of women of fortune, to vi&#383;it ho&#383;pitals,
and &#383;uperintend the conduct of inferiors.</p>

<p class="center">3.</p>
<p>It is generally &#383;uppo&#383;ed, that the
imagination of women is particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-180_S" id="Pg_4-180_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-180.png">180</a>]</span>
active, and leads them a&#383;tray. Why
then do we &#383;eek by education only to
exerci&#383;e their imagination and feeling,
till the under&#383;tanding, grown rigid by
di&#383;u&#383;e, is unable to exerci&#383;e it&#383;elf&mdash;and
the &#383;uperfluous nouri&#383;hment the
imagination and feeling have received,
renders the former romantic, and the
latter weak?</p>

<p class="center">4.</p>
<p>Few men have ri&#383;en to any great
eminence in learning, who have not
received &#383;omething like a regular education.
Why are women expected to
&#383;urmount difficulties that men are not
equal to?</p>

<p class="center">5.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more ab&#383;urd than
the ridicule of the critic, that the heroine
of his mock-tragedy was in love
with the very man whom &#383;he ought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-181_S" id="Pg_4-181_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-181.png">181</a>]</span>
lea&#383;t to have loved; he could not have
given a better rea&#383;on. How can pa&#383;&#383;ion
gain &#383;trength any other way? In Otaheite,
love cannot be known, where
the ob&#383;tacles to irritate an indi&#383;criminate
appetite, and &#383;ublimate the &#383;imple
&#383;en&#383;ations of de&#383;ire till they mount to
pa&#383;&#383;ion, are never known. There a
man or woman cannot love the very
per&#383;on they ought not to have loved&mdash;nor
does jealou&#383;y ever fan the flame.</p>

<p class="center">6.</p>
<p>It has frequently been ob&#383;erved, that,
when women have an object in view,
they pur&#383;ue it with more &#383;teadine&#383;s than
men, particularly love. This is not
a compliment. Pa&#383;&#383;ion pur&#383;ues with
more heat than rea&#383;on, and with mo&#383;t
ardour during the ab&#383;ence of rea&#383;on.</p>

<p class="center">7.</p>
<p>Men are more &#383;ubject to the phy&#383;ical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-182_S" id="Pg_4-182_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-182.png">182</a>]</span>
love than women. The confined education
of women makes them more
&#383;ubject to jealou&#383;y.</p>

<p class="center">8.</p>
<p>Simplicity &#383;eems, in general, the con&#383;equence
of ignorance, as I have ob&#383;erved
in the characters of women and
&#383;ailors&mdash;the being confined to one track
of impre&#383;&#383;ions.</p>

<p class="center">9.</p>
<p>I know of no other way of pre&#383;erving
the cha&#383;tity of mankind, than that
of rendering women rather objects of
love than de&#383;ire. The difference is
great. Yet, while women are encouraged
to ornament their per&#383;ons at the
expence of their minds, while indolence
renders them helple&#383;s and la&#383;civious
(for what other name can be
given to the common intercour&#383;e between
the &#383;exes?) they will be, gene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-183_S" id="Pg_4-183_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-183.png">183</a>]</span>rally
&#383;peaking, only objects of de&#383;ire;
and, to &#383;uch women, men cannot be
con&#383;tant. Men, accu&#383;tomed only to
have their &#383;en&#383;es moved, merely &#383;eek
for a &#383;elfi&#383;h gratification in the &#383;ociety
of women, and their &#383;exual in&#383;tinct,
being neither &#383;upported by the under&#383;tanding
nor the heart, mu&#383;t be excited
by variety.</p>

<p class="center">10.</p>
<p>We ought to re&#383;pect old opinions;
though prejudices, blindly adopted,
lead to error, and preclude all exerci&#383;e
of the rea&#383;on.</p>

<p>The emulation which often makes a
boy mi&#383;chievous, is a generous &#383;pur;
and the old remark, that unlucky, turbulent
boys, make the wi&#383;e&#383;t and be&#383;t
men, is true, &#383;pite of Mr. Knox's arguments.
It has been ob&#383;erved, that the
mo&#383;t adventurous hor&#383;es, when tamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-184_S" id="Pg_4-184_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-184.png">184</a>]</span>
or dome&#383;ticated, are the mo&#383;t mild and
tractable.</p>

<p class="center">11.</p>
<p>The children who &#383;tart up &#383;uddenly
at twelve or fourteen, and fall into decays,
in con&#383;equence, as it is termed,
of outgrowing their &#383;trength, are in
general, I believe, tho&#383;e children, who
have been bred up with mi&#383;taken tenderne&#383;s,
and not allowed to &#383;port and
take exerci&#383;e in the open air. This is
analogous to plants: for it is found that
they run up &#383;ickly, long &#383;talks, when
confined.</p>

<p class="center">12.</p>
<p>Children &#383;hould be taught to feel deference,
not to practi&#383;e &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion.</p>

<p class="center">13.</p>
<p>It is always a proof of fal&#383;e refinement,
when a fa&#383;tidious ta&#383;te overpowers
&#383;ympathy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-185_S" id="Pg_4-185_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-185.png">185</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">14.</p>
<p>Lu&#383;t appears to be the mo&#383;t natural
companion of wild ambition; and love
of human prai&#383;e, of that dominion
erected by cunning.</p>

<p class="center">15.</p>
<p>"Genius decays as judgment increa&#383;es."
Of cour&#383;e, tho&#383;e who have
the lea&#383;t genius, have the earlie&#383;t appearance
of wi&#383;dom.</p>

<p class="center">16.</p>
<p>A knowledge of the fine arts, is &#383;eldom
&#383;ub&#383;ervient to the promotion of
either religion or virtue. Elegance is
often indecency; witne&#383;s our prints.</p>

<p class="center">17.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any evil
in the world, but what is nece&#383;&#383;ary.
The doctrine of rewards and puni&#383;hments,
not con&#383;idered as a means of re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-186_S" id="Pg_4-186_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-186.png">186</a>]</span>formation,
appears to me an infamous
libel on divine goodne&#383;s.</p>

<p class="center">18.</p>
<p>Whether virtue is founded on rea&#383;on
or revelation, virtue is wi&#383;dom, and
vice is folly. Why are po&#383;itive puni&#383;hments?</p>

<p class="center">19.</p>
<p>Few can walk alone. The &#383;taff of
Chri&#383;tianity is the nece&#383;&#383;ary &#383;upport of
human weakne&#383;s. But an acquaintance
with the nature of man and virtue,
with ju&#383;t &#383;entiments on the attributes,
would be &#383;ufficient, without a voice
from heaven, to lead &#383;ome to virtue,
but not the mob.</p>

<p class="center">20.</p>
<p>I only expect the natural reward of
virtue, whatever it may be. I rely not
on a po&#383;itive reward.</p>

<p>The ju&#383;tice of God can be vindicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-187_S" id="Pg_4-187_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-187.png">187</a>]</span>
by a belief in a future &#383;tate&mdash;but a continuation
of being vindicates it as
clearly, as the po&#383;itive &#383;y&#383;tem of rewards
and puni&#383;hments&mdash;by evil educing
good for the individual, and not
for an imaginary whole. The happine&#383;s
of the whole mu&#383;t ari&#383;e from the
happine&#383;s of the con&#383;tituent parts, or
this world is not a &#383;tate of trial, but a
&#383;chool.</p>

<p class="center">21.</p>
<p>The vices acquired by Augu&#383;tus to
retain his power, mu&#383;t have tainted his
&#383;oul, and prevented that increa&#383;e of
happine&#383;s a good man expects in the
next &#383;tage of exi&#383;tence. This was a
natural puni&#383;hment.</p>

<p class="center">22.</p>
<p>The lover is ever mo&#383;t deeply enamoured,
when it is with he knows
not what&mdash;and the devotion of a my&#383;tic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-188_S" id="Pg_4-188_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-188.png">188</a>]</span>
has a rude Gothic grandeur in it, which
the re&#383;pectful adoration of a philo&#383;opher
will never reach. I may be
thought fanciful; but it has continually
occurred to me, that, though, I allow,
rea&#383;on in this world is the mother
of wi&#383;dom&mdash;yet &#383;ome flights of the imagination
&#383;eem to reach what wi&#383;dom
cannot teach&mdash;and, while they delude
us here, afford a glorious hope, if not
a foreta&#383;te, of what we may expect
hereafter. He that created us, did not
mean to mark us with ideal images of
grandeur, the <i>ba&#383;ele&#383;s fabric of a vi&#383;ion</i>&mdash;No&mdash;that
perfection we follow with
hopele&#383;s ardour when the whi&#383;perings
of rea&#383;on are heard, may be found,
when not incompatible with our &#383;tate,
in the round of eternity. Perfection
indeed mu&#383;t, even then, be a comparative
idea&mdash;but the wi&#383;dom, the hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-189_S" id="Pg_4-189_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-189.png">189</a>]</span>pine&#383;s
of a &#383;uperior &#383;tate, has been &#383;uppo&#383;ed
to be intuitive, and the happie&#383;t
effu&#383;ions of human genius have &#383;eemed
like in&#383;piration&mdash;the deductions of rea&#383;on
de&#383;troy &#383;ublimity.</p>

<p class="center">23.</p>
<p>I am more and more convinced, that
poetry is the fir&#383;t efferve&#383;cence of the
imagination, and the forerunner of civilization.</p>

<p class="center">24.</p>
<p>When the Arabs had no trace of literature
or &#383;cience, they compo&#383;ed
beautiful ver&#383;es on the &#383;ubjects of love
and war. The flights of the imagination,
and the laboured deductions of
rea&#383;on, appear almo&#383;t incompatible.</p>

<p class="center">25.</p>
<p>Poetry certainly flouri&#383;hes mo&#383;t in
the fir&#383;t rude &#383;tate of &#383;ociety. The
pa&#383;&#383;ions &#383;peak mo&#383;t eloquently, when
they are not &#383;hackled by rea&#383;on. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-190_S" id="Pg_4-190_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-190.png">190</a>]</span>
&#383;ublime expre&#383;&#383;ion, which has been &#383;o
often quoted, [Gene&#383;is, ch. 1, ver. 3.]
is perhaps a barbarous flight; or rather
the grand conception of an uncultivated
mind; for it is contrary to nature
and experience, to &#383;uppo&#383;e that this
account is founded on facts&mdash;It is
doubtle&#383;s a &#383;ublime allegory. But a
cultivated mind would not thus have
de&#383;cribed the creation&mdash;for, arguing
from analogy, it appears that creation
mu&#383;t have been a comprehen&#383;ive plan,
and that the Supreme Being always
u&#383;es &#383;econd cau&#383;es, &#383;lowly and &#383;ilently
to fulfil his purpo&#383;e. This is, in reality,
a more &#383;ublime view of that power
which wi&#383;dom &#383;upports: but it is not
the &#383;ublimity that would &#383;trike the impa&#383;&#383;ioned
mind, in which the imagination
took place of intellect. Tell a
being, who&#383;e affections and pa&#383;&#383;ions
have been more exerci&#383;ed than his rea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-191_S" id="Pg_4-191_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-191.png">191</a>]</span>&#383;on,
that God &#383;aid, <i>Let there be light!
and there was light</i>; and he would pro&#383;trate
him&#383;elf before the Being who
could thus call things out of nothing,
as if they were: but a man in whom
rea&#383;on had taken place of pa&#383;&#383;ion,
would not adore, till wi&#383;dom was con&#383;picuous
as well as power, for his admiration
mu&#383;t be founded on principle.</p>

<p class="center">26.</p>
<p>Individuality is ever con&#383;picuous in
tho&#383;e enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic flights of fancy, in
which rea&#383;on is left behind, without
being lo&#383;t &#383;ight of.</p>

<p class="center">27.</p>
<p>The mind has been too often brought
to the te&#383;t of enquiries which only
reach to matter&mdash;put into the crucible,
though the magnetic and electric fluid
e&#383;capes from the experimental philo&#383;opher.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-192_S" id="Pg_4-192_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-192.png">192</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">28.</p>
<p>Mr. Kant has ob&#383;erved, that the under&#383;tanding
is &#383;ublime, the imagination
beautiful&mdash;yet it is evident, that poets,
and men who undoubtedly po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s the
livelie&#383;t imagination, are mo&#383;t touched
by the &#383;ublime, while men who have
cold, enquiring minds, have not this
exqui&#383;ite feeling in any great degree,
and indeed &#383;eem to lo&#383;e it as they cultivate
their rea&#383;on.</p>

<p class="center">29.</p>
<p>The Grecian buildings are graceful&mdash;they
fill the mind with all tho&#383;e plea&#383;ing
emotions, which elegance and beauty
never fail to excite in a cultivated
mind&mdash;utility and grace &#383;trike us in
uni&#383;on&mdash;the mind is &#383;ati&#383;fied&mdash;things
appear ju&#383;t what they ought to be: a
calm &#383;ati&#383;faction is felt, but the imagination
has nothing to do&mdash;no ob&#383;curity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-193_S" id="Pg_4-193_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-193.png">193</a>]</span>
darkens the gloom&mdash;like rea&#383;onable
content, we can &#383;ay why we are plea&#383;ed&mdash;and
this kind of plea&#383;ure may be
la&#383;ting, but it is never great.</p>

<p class="center">30.</p>
<p>When we &#383;ay that a per&#383;on is an
original, it is only to &#383;ay in other words
that he thinks. "The le&#383;s a man has
cultivated his rational faculties, the
more powerful is the principle of
imitation, over his actions, and his
habits of thinking. Mo&#383;t women,
of cour&#383;e, are more influenced by
the behaviour, the fa&#383;hions, and the
opinions of tho&#383;e with whom they
a&#383;&#383;ociate, than men." (Smellie.)</p>

<p>When we read a book which &#383;upports
our favourite opinions, how eagerly
do we &#383;uck in the doctrines, and
&#383;uffer our minds placidly to reflect the
images which illu&#383;trate the tenets we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-194_S" id="Pg_4-194_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-194.png">194</a>]</span>
have embraced? We indolently or
quietly acquie&#383;ce in the conclu&#383;ion, and
our &#383;pirit animates and connects the
various &#383;ubjects. But, on the contrary,
when we peru&#383;e a &#383;kilful writer,
who does not coincide in opinion with
us, how is the mind on the watch to
detect fallacy? And this coolne&#383;s often
prevents our being carried away by a
&#383;tream of eloquence, which the prejudiced
mind terms declamation&mdash;a pomp
of words.&mdash;We never allow our&#383;elves to
be warmed; and, after contending
with the writer, are more confirmed
in our own opinion, as much perhaps
from a &#383;pirit of contradiction as from
rea&#383;on.&mdash;Such is the &#383;trength of man!</p>

<p class="center">31.</p>
<p>It is the individual manner of &#383;eeing
and feeling, pourtrayed by a &#383;trong
imagination in bold images that have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_4-195_S" id="Pg_4-195_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v4-195.png">195</a>]</span>
&#383;truck the &#383;en&#383;es, which creates all the
charms of poetry. A great reader is
always quoting the de&#383;cription of another's
emotions; a &#383;trong imagination
delights to paint its own. A writer of
genius makes us feel; an inferior author
rea&#383;on.</p>

<p class="center">32.</p>
<p>Some principle prior to &#383;elf-love mu&#383;t
have exi&#383;ted: the feeling which produced
the plea&#383;ure, mu&#383;t have exi&#383;ted
before the experience.</p>
