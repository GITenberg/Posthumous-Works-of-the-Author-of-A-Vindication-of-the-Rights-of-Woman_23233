<p>"<span class="smcap">I Resume</span> my pen to fly from thought.
I was married; and we hastened to
London. I had purposed taking one of
my sisters with me; for a strong motive
for marrying, was the desire of having
a home at which I could receive them,
now their own grew so uncomfortable,
as not to deserve the cheering appellation.
An objection was made to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-2" id="Pg_2-2"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-2.png">2</a>]</span>
accompanying me, that appeared plausible;
and I reluctantly acquiesced. I
was however willingly allowed to take
with me Molly, poor Peggy's daughter.
London and preferment, are ideas commonly
associated in the country; and,
as blooming as May, she bade adieu to
Peggy with weeping eyes. I did not
even feel hurt at the refusal in relation
to my sister, till hearing what my uncle
had done for me, I had the simplicity
to request, speaking with warmth of
their situation, that he would give them
a thousand pounds a-piece, which
seemed to me but justice. He asked
me, giving me a kiss, 'If I had lost my
senses?' I started back, as if I had
found a wasp in a rose-bush. I expostulated.
He sneered; and the demon
of discord entered our paradise, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-3" id="Pg_2-3"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-3.png">3</a>]</span>
poison with his pestiferous breath every
opening joy.</p>

<p>"I had sometimes observed defects
in my husband's understanding; but, led
astray by a prevailing opinion, that
goodness of disposition is of the first importance
in the relative situations of
life, in proportion as I perceived the
narrowness of his understanding, fancy
enlarged the boundary of his heart.
Fatal error! How quickly is the so
much vaunted milkiness of nature turned
into gall, by an intercourse with the
world, if more generous juices do not
sustain the vital source of virtue!</p>

<p>"One trait in my character was extreme
credulity; but, when my eyes were
once opened, I saw but too clearly all
I had before overlooked. My husband
was sunk in my esteem; still there are
youthful emotions, which, for a while,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-4" id="Pg_2-4"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-4.png">4</a>]</span>
fill up the chasm of love and friendship.
Besides, it required some time to enable
me to see his whole character in a
just light, or rather to allow it to become
fixed. While circumstances were
ripening my faculties, and cultivating
my taste, commerce and gross relaxations
were shutting his against any
possibility of improvement, till, by
stifling every spark of virtue in himself,
he began to imagine that it no where
existed.</p>

<p>"Do not let me lead you astray, my
child, I do not mean to assert, that
any human being is entirely incapable
of feeling the generous emotions, which
are the foundation of every true principle
of virtue; but they are frequently,
I fear, so feeble, that, like the inflammable
quality which more or less
lurks in all bodies, they often lie for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-5" id="Pg_2-5"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-5.png">5</a>]</span>
ever dormant; the circumstances never
occurring, necessary to call them into
action.</p>

<p>"I discovered however by chance,
that, in consequence of some losses in
trade, the natural effect of his gambling
desire to start suddenly into riches,
the five thousand pounds given me by
my uncle, had been paid very opportunely.
This discovery, strange as you
may think the assertion, gave me pleasure;
my husband's embarrassments
endeared him to me. I was glad to
find an excuse for his conduct to my
sisters, and my mind became calmer.</p>

<p>"My uncle introduced me to some
literary society; and the theatres were
a never-failing source of amusement to
me. My delighted eye followed Mrs.
Siddons, when, with dignified delicacy,
she played Calista; and I involuntarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-6" id="Pg_2-6"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-6.png">6</a>]</span>
repeated after her, in the same tone,
and with a long-drawn sigh,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hearts like our's were pair'd&mdash;not match'd.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"These were, at first, spontaneous
emotions, though, becoming acquainted
with men of wit and polished manners,
I could not sometimes help regretting
my early marriage; and that,
in my haste to escape from a temporary
dependence, and expand my newly
fledged wings, in an unknown sky, I
had been caught in a trap, and caged
for life. Still the novelty of London,
and the attentive fondness of my husband,
for he had some personal regard
for me, made several months glide
away. Yet, not forgetting the situation
of my sisters, who were still very
young, I prevailed on my uncle to set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-7" id="Pg_2-7"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-7.png">7</a>]</span>tle
a thousand pounds on each; and
to place them in a school near town,
where I could frequently visit, as well
as have them at home with me.</p>

<p>"I now tried to improve my husband's
taste, but we had few subjects in
common; indeed he soon appeared
to have little relish for my society, unless
he was hinting to me the use he
could make of my uncle's wealth.
When we had company, I was disgusted
by an ostentatious display of
riches, and I have often quitted the
room, to avoid listening to exaggerated
tales of money obtained by lucky hits.</p>

<p>"With all my attention and affectionate
interest, I perceived that I
could not become the friend or confident
of my husband. Every thing I
learned relative to his affairs I gathered
up by accident; and I vainly endea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-8" id="Pg_2-8"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-8.png">8</a>]</span>voured
to establish, at our fire-side,
that social converse, which often renders
people of different characters dear to
each other. Returning from the theatre,
or any amusing party, I frequently
began to relate what I had seen and
highly relished; but with sullen taciturnity
he soon silenced me. I seemed
therefore gradually to lose, in his society,
the soul, the energies of which
had just been in action. To such a degree,
in fact, did his cold, reserved
manner affect me, that, after spending
some days with him alone, I have
imagined myself the most stupid creature
in the world, till the abilities of
some casual visitor convinced me that I
had some dormant animation, and sentiments
above the dust in which I had
been groveling. The very countenance
of my husband changed; his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-9" id="Pg_2-9"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-9.png">9</a>]</span>plexion
became sallow, and all the
charms of youth were vanishing with
its vivacity.</p>

<p>"I give you one view of the subject;
but these experiments and alterations
took up the space of five years; during
which period, I had most reluctantly extorted
several sums from my uncle, to
save my husband, to use his own words,
from destruction. At first it was to prevent
bills being noted, to the injury of
his credit; then to bail him; and afterwards
to prevent an execution from
entering the house. I began at last to
conclude, that he would have made
more exertions of his own to extricate
himself, had he not relied on mine,
cruel as was the task he imposed on me;
and I firmly determined that I would
make use of no more pretexts.</p>

<p>"From the moment I pronounced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-10" id="Pg_2-10"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-10.png">10</a>]</span>
this determination, indifference on his
part was changed into rudeness, or
something worse.</p>

<p>"He now seldom dined at home,
and continually returned at a late hour,
drunk, to bed. I retired to another
apartment; I was glad, I own, to
escape from his; for personal intimacy
without affection, seemed, to me the
most degrading, as well as the most
painful state in which a woman of any
taste, not to speak of the peculiar delicacy
of fostered sensibility, could be
placed. But my husband's fondness
for women was of the grossest kind,
and imagination was so wholly out of
the question, as to render his indulgences
of this sort entirely promiscuous,
and of the most brutal nature.
My health suffered, before my heart
was entirely estranged by the loath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-11" id="Pg_2-11"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-11.png">11</a>]</span>some
information; could I then have
returned to his sullied arms, but as a
victim to the prejudices of mankind,
who have made women the property of
their husbands? I discovered even,
by his conversation, when intoxicated,
that his favourites were wantons of the
lowest class, who could by their vulgar,
indecent mirth, which he called nature,
rouse his sluggish spirits. Meretricious
ornaments and manners were
necessary to attract his attention. He
seldom looked twice at a modest woman,
and sat silent in their company;
and the charms of youth and beauty
had not the slightest effect on his senses,
unless the possessors were initiated in
vice. His intimacy with profligate women,
and his habits of thinking, gave
him a contempt for female endowments;
and he would repeat, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-12" id="Pg_2-12"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-12.png">12</a>]</span>
wine had loosed his tongue, most of the
common-place sarcasms levelled at
them, by men who do not allow them
to have minds, because mind would be
an impediment to gross enjoyment.
Men who are inferior to their fellow
men, are always most anxious to establish
their superiority over women.
But where are these reflections leading
me?</p>

<p>"Women who have lost their husband's
affection, are justly reproved for
neglecting their persons, and not taking
the same pains to keep, as to gain a
heart; but who thinks of giving the
same advice to men, though women
are continually stigmatized for being
attached to fops; and from the nature
of their education, are more susceptible
of disgust? Yet why a woman should
be expected to endure a sloven, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-13" id="Pg_2-13"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-13.png">13</a>]</span>
more patience than a man, and magnanimously
to govern herself, I cannot
conceive; unless it be supposed arrogant
in her to look for respect as well as a
maintenance. It is not easy to be
pleased, because, after promising to
love, in different circumstances, we are
told that it is our duty. I cannot, I
am sure (though, when attending the
sick, I never felt disgust) forget my
own sensations, when rising with health
and spirit, and after scenting the sweet
morning, I have met my husband at
the breakfast table. The active attention
I had been giving to domestic regulations,
which were generally settled
before he rose, or a walk, gave a glow
to my countenance, that contrasted with
his squallid appearance. The squeamishness
of stomach alone, produced
by the last night's intemperance, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-14" id="Pg_2-14"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-14.png">14</a>]</span>
he took no pains to conceal, destroyed
my appetite. I think I now see him
lolling in an arm-chair, in a dirty powdering
gown, soiled linen, ungartered
stockings, and tangled hair, yawning
and stretching himself. The newspaper
was immediately called for, if not
brought in on the tea-board, from
which he would scarcely lift his eyes
while I poured out the tea, excepting
to ask for some brandy to put into it, or
to declare that he could not eat. In
answer to any question, in his best humour,
it was a drawling 'What do
you say, child?' But if I demanded
money for the house expences, which I
put off till the last moment, his customary
reply, often prefaced with an
oath, was, 'Do you think me, madam,
made of money?'&mdash;The butcher,
the baker, must wait; and, what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-15" id="Pg_2-15"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-15.png">15</a>]</span>
worse, I was often obliged to witness
his surly dismission of tradesmen, who
were in want of their money, and
whom I sometimes paid with the presents
my uncle gave me for my own
use.</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins>At this juncture my father's mistress,
by terrifying his conscience, prevailed
on him to marry her; he was already
become a methodist; and my brother,
who now practised for himself, had discovered
a flaw in the settlement made
on my mother's children, which set it
aside, and he allowed my father, whose
distress made him submit to any thing,
a tithe of his own, or rather our fortune.</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins>My sisters had left school, but were
unable to endure home, which my father's
wife rendered as disagreeable as
possible, to get rid of girls whom she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-16" id="Pg_2-16"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-16.png">16</a>]</span>
regarded as spies on her conduct. They
were accomplished, yet you can (may
you never be reduced to the same destitute
state!) scarcely conceive the trouble
I had to place them in the situation
of governesses, the only one in which
even a well-educated woman, with
more than ordinary talents, can struggle
for a subsistence; and even this is a
dependence next to menial. Is it then
surprising, that so many forlorn women,
with human passions and feelings, take
refuge in infamy? Alone in large mansions,
I say alone, because they had no
companions with whom they could converse
on equal terms, or from whom
they could expect the endearments of
affection, they grew melancholy, and
the sound of joy made them sad; and
the youngest, having a more delicate
frame, fell into a decline. It was with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-17" id="Pg_2-17"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-17.png">17</a>]</span>
great difficulty that I, who now almost
supported the house by loans from my
uncle, could prevail on the <i>master</i> of it,
to allow her a room to die in. I watched
her sick bed for some months, and then
closed her eyes, gentle spirit! for ever.
She was pretty, with very engaging
manners; yet had never an opportunity
to marry, excepting to a very old man.
She had abilities sufficient to have
shone in any profession, had there been
any professions for women, though she
shrunk at the name of milliner or mantua-maker
as degrading to a gentlewoman.
I would not term this feeling
false pride to any one but you, my
child, whom I fondly hope to see (yes;
I will indulge the hope for a moment!)
possessed of that energy of character
which gives dignity to any station; and
with that clear, firm spirit that will en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-18" id="Pg_2-18"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-18.png">18</a>]</span>able
you to choose a situation for yourself,
or submit to be classed in the lowest,
if it be the only one in which you
can be the mistress of your own actions.</p>

<p>"Soon after the death of my sister,
an incident occurred, to prove to me that
the heart of a libertine is dead to natural
affection; and to convince me,
that the being who has appeared all
tenderness, to gratify a selfish passion,
is as regardless of the innocent fruit of
it, as of the object, when the fit is over.
I had casually observed an old, mean-looking
woman, who called on my husband
every two or three months to receive
some money. One day entering
the passage of his little counting-house,
as she was going out, I
heard her say, 'The child is very weak;
she cannot live long, she will soon die<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-19" id="Pg_2-19"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-19.png">19</a>]</span>
out of your way, so you need not grudge
her a little physic.'</p>

<p>"'So much the better,' he replied,
'and pray mind your own business,
good woman.'</p>

<p>"I was struck by his unfeeling, inhuman
tone of voice, and drew back,
determined when the woman came
again, to try to speak to her, not out
of curiosity, I had heard enough, but
with the hope of being useful to a poor,
outcast girl.</p>

<p>"A month or two elapsed before I
saw this woman again; and then she
had a child in her hand that tottered
along, scarcely able to sustain her own
weight. They were going away, to
return at the hour Mr. Venables was
expected; he was now from home. I
desired the woman to walk into the
parlour. She hesitated, yet obeyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-20" id="Pg_2-20"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-20.png">20</a>]</span>
I assured her that I should not mention
to my husband (the word seemed to
weigh on my respiration), that I had seen
her, or his child. The woman stared
at me with astonishment; and I turned
my eyes on the squalid object [that accompanied
her.] She could hardly support
herself, her complexion was sallow,
and her eyes inflamed, with an indescribable
look of cunning, mixed with
the wrinkles produced by the peevishness
of pain.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins>Poor child!' I exclaimed. 'Ah!
you may well say poor child,' replied
the woman. 'I brought her here to see
whether he would have the heart to
look at her, and not get some advice.
I do not know what they deserve who
nursed her. Why, her legs bent under
her like a bow when she came to me,
and she has never been well since; but,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-21" id="Pg_2-21"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-21.png">21</a>]</span>
if they were no better paid than I am,
it is not to be wondered at, sure
enough.'</p>

<p>"On further enquiry I was informed,
that this miserable spectacle was the
daughter of a servant, a country girl,
who caught Mr. Venables' eye, and
whom he seduced. On his marriage he
sent her away, her situation being too
visible. After her delivery, she was
thrown on the town; and died in an
hospital within the year. The babe
was sent to a parish-nurse, and afterwards
to this woman, who did not
seem much better; but what was to be
expected from such a close bargain?
She was only paid three shillings a week
for board and washing.</p>

<p>"The woman begged me to give her
some old clothes for the child, assuring
me, that she was almost afraid to ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-22" id="Pg_2-22"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-22.png">22</a>]</span>
master for money to buy even a pair
of shoes.</p>

<p>"I grew sick at heart. And, fearing
Mr. Venables might enter, and oblige
me to express my abhorrence, I hastily
enquired where she lived, promised to
pay her two shillings a week more, and
to call on her in a day or two; putting
a trifle into her hand as a proof of my
good intention.</p>

<p>"If the state of this child affected me,
what were my feelings at a discovery I
made respecting Peggy&mdash;&mdash;?<a name="FNanchor_22-A_6" id="FNanchor_22-A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_22-A_6" class="fnanchor">[22-A]</a></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> father's situation was now so
distressing, that I prevailed on my uncle
to accompany me to visit him; and
to lend me his assistance, to prevent the
whole property of the family from becoming
the prey of my brother's rapacity;
for, to extricate himself out of
present difficulties, my father was totally
regardless of futurity. I took
down with me some presents for my
step-mother; it did not require an effort
for me to treat her with civility, or
to forget the past.</p>

<p>"This was the first time I had visited
my native village, since my marriage.
But with what different emotions did
I return from the busy world, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-24" id="Pg_2-24"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-24.png">24</a>]</span>
heavy weight of experience benumbing
my imagination, to scenes, that whispered
recollections of joy and hope
most eloquently to my heart! The
first scent of the wild flowers from the
heath, thrilled through my veins, awakening
every sense to pleasure. The icy
hand of despair seemed to be removed
from my bosom; and&mdash;forgetting my
husband&mdash;the nurtured visions of a romantic
mind, bursting on me with all
their original wildness and gay exuberance,
were again hailed as sweet realities.
I forgot, with equal facility,
that I ever felt sorrow, or knew care
in the country; while a transient rainbow
stole athwart the cloudy sky of despondency.
The picturesque form of
several favourite trees, and the porches
of rude cottages, with their smiling
hedges, were recognized with the glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-25" id="Pg_2-25"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-25.png">25</a>]</span>some
playfulness of childish vivacity.
I could have kissed the chickens that
pecked on the common; and longed to
pat the cows, and frolic with the dogs
that sported on it. I gazed with delight
on the windmill, and thought it
lucky that it should be in motion, at
the moment I passed by; and entering
the dear green lane, which led directly
to the village, the sound of the well-known
rookery gave that sentimental
tinge to the varying sensations of my
active soul, which only served to
heighten the lustre of the luxuriant
scenery. But, spying, as I advanced,
the spire, peeping over the withered tops
of the aged elms that composed the
rookery, my thoughts flew immediately
to the church-yard, and tears of affection,
such was the effect of my imagination,
bedewed my mother's grave!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-26" id="Pg_2-26"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-26.png">26</a>]</span>
Sorrow gave place to devotional feelings.
I wandered through the church
in fancy, as I used sometimes to do on
a Saturday evening. I recollected with
what fervour I addressed the God of
my youth: and once more with rapturous
love looked above my sorrows
to the Father of nature. I pause&mdash;feeling
forcibly all the emotions I am describing;
and (reminded, as I register
my sorrows, of the sublime calm I have
felt, when in some tremendous solitude,
my soul rested on itself, and
seemed to fill the universe) I insensibly
breathe soft, hushing every wayward
emotion, as if fearing to sully with a
sigh, a contentment so extatic.</p>

<p>"Having settled my father's affairs,
and, by my exertions in his favour, made
my brother my sworn foe, I returned
to London. My husband's conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-27" id="Pg_2-27"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-27.png">27</a>]</span>
was now changed; I had during my
absence, received several affectionate,
penitential letters from him; and he
seemed on my arrival, to wish by his
behaviour to prove his sincerity. I
could not then conceive why he acted
thus; and, when the suspicion darted
into my head, that it might arise from
observing my increasing influence with
my uncle, I almost despised myself for
imagining that such a degree of debasing
selfishness could exist.</p>

<p>"He became, unaccountable as was
the change, tender and attentive; and,
attacking my weak side, made a confession
of his follies, and lamented the
embarrassments in which I, who merited
a far different fate, might be involved.
He besought me to aid him with my
counsel, praised my understanding, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-28" id="Pg_2-28"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-28.png">28</a>]</span>
appealed to the tenderness of my
heart.</p>

<p>"This conduct only inspired me with
compassion. I wished to be his friend;
but love had spread his rosy pinions,
and fled far, far away; and had not
(like some exquisite perfumes, the fine
spirit of which is continually mingling
with the air) left a fragrance behind,
to mark where he had shook his wings.
My husband's renewed caresses then
became hateful to me; his brutality
was tolerable, compared to his distasteful
fondness. Still, compassion, and
the fear of insulting his supposed feelings,
by a want of sympathy, made
me dissemble, and do violence to my
delicacy. What a task!</p>

<p>"Those who support a system of
what I term false refinement, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-29" id="Pg_2-29"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-29.png">29</a>]</span>
not allow great part of love in the female,
as well as male breast, to spring
in some respects involuntarily, may not
admit that charms are as necessary to
feed the passion, as virtues to convert
the mellowing spirit into friendship. To
such observers I have nothing to say,
any more than to the moralists, who insist
that women ought to, and can love
their husbands, because it is their duty.
To you, my child, I may add, with a
heart tremblingly alive to your future
conduct, some observations, dictated
by my present feelings, on calmly reviewing
this period of my life. When
novelists or moralists praise as a virtue,
a woman's coldness of constitution, and
want of passion; and make her yield
to the ardour of her lover out of sheer
compassion, or to promote a frigid plan
of future comfort, I am disgusted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-30" id="Pg_2-30"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-30.png">30</a>]</span>
They may be good women, in the ordinary
acceptation of the phrase, and do
no harm; but they appear to me not to
have those 'finely fashioned nerves,'
which render the senses exquisite. They
may possess tenderness; but they want
that fire of the imagination, which produces
<i>active</i> sensibility, and <i>positive</i> virtue.
How does the woman deserve to
be characterized, who marries one man,
with a heart and imagination devoted
to another? Is she not an object of
pity or contempt, when thus sacrilegiously
violating the purity of her own
feelings? Nay, it is as indelicate, when
she is indifferent, unless she be constitutionally
insensible; then indeed it is
a mere affair of barter; and I have nothing
to do with the secrets of trade.
Yes; eagerly as I wish you to possess
true rectitude of mind, and purity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-31" id="Pg_2-31"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-31.png">31</a>]</span>
affection, I must insist that a heartless
conduct is the contrary of virtuous.
Truth is the only basis of virtue; and
we cannot, without depraving our
minds, endeavour to please a lover or
husband, but in proportion as he
pleases us. Men, more effectually to
enslave us, may inculcate this partial
morality, and lose sight of virtue in
subdividing it into the duties of particular
stations; but let us not blush for
nature without a cause!</p>

<p>"After these remarks, I am ashamed
to own, that I was pregnant. The
greatest sacrifice of my principles in my
whole life, was the allowing my husband
again to be familiar with my person,
though to this cruel act of self-denial,
when I wished the earth to
open and swallow me, you owe your
birth; and I the unutterable pleasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-32" id="Pg_2-32"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-32.png">32</a>]</span>
of being a mother. There was something
of delicacy in my husband's bridal
attentions; but now his tainted breath,
pimpled face, and blood-shot eyes,
were not more repugnant to my senses,
than his gross manners, and loveless
familiarity to my taste.</p>

<p>"A man would only be expected to
maintain; yes, barely grant a subsistence,
to a woman rendered odious by
habitual intoxication; but who would
expect him, or think it possible to love
her? And unless 'youth, and genial
years were flown,' it would be thought
equally unreasonable to insist, [under
penalty of] forfeiting almost every thing
reckoned valuable in life, that he
should not love another: whilst woman,
weak in reason, impotent in will,
is required to moralize, sentimentalize
herself to stone, and pine her life away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-33" id="Pg_2-33"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-33.png">33</a>]</span>
labouring to reform her embruted
mate. He may even spend in dissipation,
and intemperance, the very intemperance
which renders him so hateful,
her property, and by stinting her
expences, not permit her to beguile in
society, a wearisome, joyless life; for
over their mutual fortune she has no
power, it must all pass through his
hand. And if she be a mother, and
in the present state of women, it is a
great misfortune to be prevented from
discharging the duties, and cultivating
the affections of one, what has she not
to endure?&mdash;But I have suffered the
tenderness of one to lead me into reflections
that I did not think of making,
to interrupt my narrative&mdash;yet the full
heart will overflow.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables' embarrassments did
not now endear him to me; still, anxi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-34" id="Pg_2-34"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-34.png">34</a>]</span>ous
to befriend him, I endeavoured to
prevail on him to retrench his expences;
but he had always some plausible
excuse to give, to justify his not
following my advice. Humanity, compassion,
and the interest produced by a
habit of living together, made me try
to relieve, and sympathize with him;
but, when I recollected that I was
bound to live with such a being for
ever&mdash;my heart died within me; my
desire of improvement became languid,
and baleful, corroding melancholy took
possession of my soul. Marriage had
bastilled me for life. I discovered in
myself a capacity for the enjoyment of
the various pleasures existence affords;
yet, fettered by the partial laws of society,
this fair globe was to me an
universal blank.</p>

<p>"When I exhorted my husband to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-35" id="Pg_2-35"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-35.png">35</a>]</span>
economy, I referred to himself. I was
obliged to practise the most rigid, or
contract debts, which I had too much
reason to fear would never be paid. I
despised this paltry privilege of a wife,
which can only be of use to the vicious
or inconsiderate, and determined not to
increase the torrent that was bearing
him down. I was then ignorant of
the extent of his fraudulent speculations,
whom I was bound to honour
and obey.</p>

<p>"A woman neglected by her husband,
or whose manners form a striking
contrast with his, will always have
men on the watch to soothe and flatter
her. Besides, the forlorn state of a
neglected woman, not destitute of personal
charms, is particularly interesting,
and rouses that species of pity,
which is so near akin, it easily slides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-36" id="Pg_2-36"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-36.png">36</a>]</span>
into love. A man of feeling thinks
not of seducing, he is himself seduced
by all the noblest emotions of his soul.
He figures to himself all the sacrifices a
woman of sensibility must make, and
every situation in which his imagination
places her, touches his heart,
and fires his passions. Longing to
take to his bosom the shorn lamb, and
bid the drooping buds of hope revive,
benevolence changes into passion:
and should he then discover that he is
beloved, honour binds him fast, though
foreseeing that he may afterwards be
obliged to pay severe damages to the
man, who never appeared to value his
wife's society, till he found that there
was a chance of his being indemnified
for the loss of it.</p>

<p>"Such are the partial laws enacted
by men; for, only to lay a stress on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-37" id="Pg_2-37"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-37.png">37</a>]</span>
dependent state of a woman in the
grand question of the comforts arising
from the possession of property, she is
[even in this article] much more injured
by the loss of the husband's affection,
than he by that of his wife; yet where
is she, condemned to the solitude of a
deserted home, to look for a compensation
from the woman, who seduces
him from her? She cannot drive an
unfaithful husband from his house, nor
separate, or tear, his children from
him, however culpable he may be; and
he, still the master of his own fate, enjoys
the smiles of a world, that would
brand her with infamy, did she, seeking
consolation, venture to retaliate.</p>

<p>"These remarks are not dictated by
experience; but merely by the compassion
I feel for many amiable women,
the <i>out-laws</i> of the world. For my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-38" id="Pg_2-38"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-38.png">38</a>]</span>self,
never encouraging any of the advances
that were made to me, my lovers
dropped off like the untimely shoots of
spring. I did not even coquet with
them; because I found, on examining
myself, I could not coquet with a man
without loving him a little; and I perceived
that I should not be able to
stop at the line of what are termed <i>innocent
freedoms</i>, did I suffer any. My
reserve was then the consequence of
delicacy. Freedom of conduct has
emancipated many women's minds;
but my conduct has most rigidly been
governed by my principles, till the improvement
of my understanding has
enabled me to discern the fallacy of
prejudices at war with nature and
reason.</p>

<p>"Shortly after the change I have
mentioned in my husband's conduct,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-39" id="Pg_2-39"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-39.png">39</a>]</span>
my uncle was compelled by his declining
health, to seek the succour of a
milder climate, and embark for Lisbon.
He left his will in the hands of a friend,
an eminent solicitor; he had previously
questioned me relative to my situation
and state of mind, and declared very
freely, that he could place no reliance
on the stability of my husband's professions.
He had been deceived in the
unfolding of his character; he now
thought it fixed in a train of actions
that would inevitably lead to ruin and
disgrace.</p>

<p>"The evening before his departure,
which we spent alone together, he
folded me to his heart, uttering the endearing
appellation of 'child.'&mdash;My
more than father! why was I not permitted
to perform the last duties of
one, and smooth the pillow of death?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-40" id="Pg_2-40"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-40.png">40</a>]</span>
He seemed by his manner to be convinced
that he should never see me
more; yet requested me, most earnestly,
to come to him, should I be obliged to
leave my husband. He had before expressed
his sorrow at hearing of my
pregnancy, having determined to prevail
on me to accompany him, till I
informed him of that circumstance. He
expressed himself unfeignedly sorry that
any new tie should bind me to a man
whom he thought so incapable of estimating
my value; such was the kind
language of affection.</p>

<p>"I must repeat his own words; they
made an indelible impression on my
mind:</p>

<p>"'The marriage state is certainly that
in which women, generally speaking,
can be most useful; but I am far from
thinking that a woman, once married,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-41" id="Pg_2-41"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-41.png">41</a>]</span>
ought to consider the engagement as
indissoluble (especially if there be no
children to reward her for sacrificing
her feelings) in case her husband
merits neither her love, nor esteem.
Esteem will often supply the place of
love; and prevent a woman from being
wretched, though it may not
make her happy. The magnitude of
a sacrifice ought always to bear some
proportion to the utility in view;
and for a woman to live with a man,
for whom she can cherish neither affection
nor esteem, or even be of any
use to him, excepting in the light of
a house-keeper, is an abjectness of
condition, the enduring of which no
concurrence of circumstances can
ever make a duty in the sight of God
or just men. If indeed she submits to
it merely to be maintained in idleness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-42" id="Pg_2-42"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-42.png">42</a>]</span>
she has no right to complain bitterly
of her fate; or to act, as a person of
independent character might, as if
she had a title to disregard general
rules.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins>But the misfortune is, that many
women only submit in appearance,
and forfeit their own respect to secure
their reputation in the world. The
situation of a woman separated from
her husband, is undoubtedly very different
from that of a man who has
left his wife. He, with lordly dignity,
has shaken of a clog; and the allowing
her food and raiment, is
thought sufficient to secure his reputation
from taint. And, should she
have been inconsiderate, he will be
celebrated for his generosity and forbearance.
Such is the respect paid to
the master-key of property! A wo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-43" id="Pg_2-43"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-43.png">43</a>]</span>man,
on the contrary, resigning what
is termed her natural protector (though
he never was so, but in name) is
despised and shunned, for asserting
the independence of mind distinctive
of a rational being, and spurning at
slavery.'</p>

<p>"During the remainder of the evening,
my uncle's tenderness led him frequently
to revert to the subject, and
utter, with increasing warmth, sentiments
to the same purport. At length
it was necessary to say 'Farewell!'&mdash;and
we parted&mdash;gracious God! to meet no
more.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XI" id="CHAP_XI"></a>CHAP. XI.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of large fortune
and of polished manners, had lately
visited very frequently at our house,
and treated me, if possible, with more
respect than Mr. Venables paid him;
my pregnancy was not yet visible,
his society was a great relief to me, as
I had for some time past, to avoid expence,
confined myself very much at
home. I ever disdained unnecessary,
perhaps even prudent concealments;
and my husband, with great ease, discovered
the amount of my uncle's parting
present. A copy of a writ was the
stale pretext to extort it from me; and
I had soon reason to believe that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-45" id="Pg_2-45"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-45.png">45</a>]</span>
fabricated for the purpose. I acknowledge
my folly in thus suffering myself
to be continually imposed on. I had
adhered to my resolution not to apply
to my uncle, on the part of my husband,
any more; yet, when I had received
a sum sufficient to supply my own
wants, and to enable me to pursue a
plan I had in view, to settle my younger
brother in a respectable employment,
I allowed myself to be duped by
Mr. Venables' shallow pretences, and
hypocritical professions.</p>

<p>"Thus did he pillage me and my
family, thus frustrate all my plans of
usefulness. Yet this was the man I was
bound to respect and esteem: as if respect
and esteem depended on an arbitrary
will of our own! But a wife being
as much a man's property as his
horse, or his ass, she has nothing she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-46" id="Pg_2-46"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-46.png">46</a>]</span>
can call her own. He may use any
means to get at what the law considers
as his, the moment his wife is in
possession of it, even to the forcing of
a lock, as Mr. Venables did, to search
for notes in my writing-desk&mdash;and all
this is done with a show of equity, because,
forsooth, he is responsible for
her maintenance.</p>

<p>"The tender mother cannot <i>lawfully</i>
snatch from the gripe of the
gambling spendthrift, or beastly
drunkard, unmindful of his offspring,
the fortune which falls to her by
chance; or (so flagrant is the injustice)
what she earns by her own exertions.
No; he can rob her with impunity,
even to waste publicly on a courtezan;
and the laws of her country&mdash;if women
have a country&mdash;afford her no protection
or redress from the oppressor, un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-47" id="Pg_2-47"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-47.png">47</a>]</span>less
she have the plea of bodily fear;
yet how many ways are there of goading
the soul almost to madness, equally
unmanly, though not so mean? When
such laws were framed, should not
impartial lawgivers have first decreed,
in the style of a great assembly, who recognized
the existence of an <i>&ecirc;tre supr&ecirc;me</i>,
to fix the national belief, that
the husband should always be wiser and
more virtuous than his wife, in order
to entitle him, with a show of justice,
to keep this idiot, or perpetual minor,
for ever in bondage. But I must have
done&mdash;on this subject, my indignation
continually runs away with me.</p>

<p>"The company of the gentleman I
have already mentioned, who had a
general acquaintance with literature
and subjects of taste, was grateful to
me; my countenance brightened up as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-48" id="Pg_2-48"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-48.png">48</a>]</span>
he approached, and I unaffectedly
expressed the pleasure I felt. The
amusement his conversation afforded
me, made it easy to comply with my
husband's request, to endeavour to render
our house agreeable to him.</p>

<p>"His attentions became more
pointed; but, as I was not of the
number of women, whose virtue, as
it is termed, immediately takes alarm,
I endeavoured, rather by raillery than
serious expostulation, to give a different
turn to his conversation. He assumed a
new mode of attack, and I was, for a
while, the dupe of his pretended
friendship.</p>

<p>"I had, merely in the style of <i>badinage</i>,
boasted of my conquest, and repeated
his lover-like compliments to
my husband. But he begged me, for
God's sake, not to affront his friend, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-49" id="Pg_2-49"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-49.png">49</a>]</span>
I should destroy all his projects, and be
his ruin. Had I had more affection for
my husband, I should have expressed
my contempt of this time-serving politeness:
now I imagined that I only
felt pity; yet it would have puzzled a
casuist to point out in what the exact
difference consisted.</p>

<p>"This friend began now, in confidence,
to discover to me the real state
of my husband's affairs. 'Necessity,'
said Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;; why should I reveal
his name? for he affected to palliate the
conduct he could not excuse, 'had
led him to take such steps, by accommodation
bills, buying goods on credit,
to sell them for ready money, and similar
transactions, that his character in
the commercial world was gone. He
was considered,' he added, lowering
his voice, 'on 'Change as a swindler.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-50" id="Pg_2-50"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-50.png">50</a>]</span>
"I felt at that moment the first maternal
pang. Aware of the evils my
sex have to struggle with, I still wished,
for my own consolation, to be the mother
of a daughter; and I could not
bear to think, that the <i>sins</i> of her father's
entailed disgrace, should be added
to the ills to which woman is heir.</p>

<p>"So completely was I deceived by
these shows of friendship (nay, I believe,
according to his interpretation, Mr. S&mdash;
really was my friend) that I began
to consult him respecting the best mode
of retrieving my husband's character:
it is the good name of a woman only
that sets to rise no more. I knew
not that he had been drawn into a
whirlpool, out of which he had not
the energy to attempt to escape. He
seemed indeed destitute of the power
of employing his faculties in any regu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-51" id="Pg_2-51"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-51.png">51</a>]</span>lar
pursuit. His principles of action
were so loose, and his mind so uncultivated,
that every thing like order appeared
to him in the shape of restraint;
and, like men in the savage state, he
required the strong stimulus of hope
or fear, produced by wild speculations,
in which the interests of others went
for nothing, to keep his spirits awake.
He one time possessed patriotism, but
he knew not what it was to feel honest
indignation; and pretended to be an advocate
for liberty, when, with as little
affection for the human race as for individuals,
he thought of nothing but
his own gratification. He was just
such a citizen, as a father. The sums
he adroitly obtained by a violation of
the laws of his country, as well as
those of humanity, he would allow a
mistress to squander; though she was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-52" id="Pg_2-52"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-52.png">52</a>]</span>
with the same <i>sang froid</i>, consigned, as
were his children, to poverty, when
another proved more attractive.</p>

<p>"On various pretences, his friend
continued to visit me; and, observing
my want of money, he tried to induce
me to accept of pecuniary aid; but this
offer I absolutely rejected, though it
was made with such delicacy, I could
not be displeased.</p>

<p>"One day he came, as I thought
accidentally, to dinner. My husband
was very much engaged in business,
and quitted the room soon after the
cloth was removed. We conversed as
usual, till confidential advice led again
to love. I was extremely mortified.
I had a sincere regard for him, and
hoped that he had an equal friendship
for me. I therefore began mildly to
expostulate with him. This gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-53" id="Pg_2-53"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-53.png">53</a>]</span>ness
he mistook for coy encouragement;
and he would not be diverted
from the subject. Perceiving his mistake,
I seriously asked him how, using
such language to me, he could profess
to be my husband's friend? A significant
sneer excited my curiosity, and he,
supposing this to be my only scruple,
took a letter deliberately out of his
pocket, saying, 'Your husband's honour
is not inflexible. How could you,
with your discernment, think it so?
Why, he left the room this very day
on purpose to give me an opportunity
to explain myself; <i>he</i> thought me too
timid&mdash;too tardy.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins></p>

<p>"I snatched the letter with indescribable
emotion. The purport of it
was to invite him to dinner, and to ridicule
his chivalrous respect for me.
He assured him, 'that every woman had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-54" id="Pg_2-54"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-54.png">54</a>]</span>
her price, and, with gross indecency,
hinted, that he should be glad to have
the duty of a husband taken off his
hands. These he termed <i>liberal sentiments</i>.
He advised him not to shock my
romantic notions, but to attack my
credulous generosity, and weak pity;
and concluded with requesting him to
lend him five hundred pounds for a
month or six weeks.' I read this letter
twice over; and the firm purpose it inspired,
calmed the rising tumult of my
soul. I rose deliberately, requested
Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; to wait a moment, and instantly
going into the counting-house,
desired Mr. Venables to return with me
to the dining-parlour.</p>

<p>"He laid down his pen, and entered
with me, without observing any change
in my countenance. I shut the door,
and, giving him the letter, simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-55" id="Pg_2-55"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-55.png">55</a>]</span>
asked, 'whether he wrote it, or was it
a forgery?'</p>

<p>"Nothing could equal his confusion.
His friend's eye met his, and
he muttered something about a joke&mdash;But
I interrupted him&mdash;'It is sufficient&mdash;We
part for ever.'</p>

<p>"I continued, with solemnity, 'I
have borne with your tyranny and infidelities.
I disdain to utter what I
have borne with. I thought you unprincipled,
but not so decidedly
vicious. I formed a tie, in the sight of
heaven&mdash;I have held it sacred; even
when men, more conformable to my
taste, have made me feel&mdash;I despise all
subterfuge!&mdash;that I was not dead to
love. Neglected by you, I have resolutely
stifled the enticing emotions, and
respected the plighted faith you outraged.
And you dare now to insult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-56" id="Pg_2-56"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-56.png">56</a>]</span>
me, by selling me to prostitution!&mdash;Yes&mdash;equally
lost to delicacy and principle&mdash;you
dared sacrilegiously to barter
the honour of the mother of your
child.'</p>

<p>"Then, turning to Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, I
added, 'I call on you, Sir, to witness,'
and I lifted my hands and eyes to heaven,
'that, as solemnly as I took his
name, I now abjure it,' I pulled off my
ring, and put it on the table; 'and that
I mean immediately to quit his house,
never to enter it more. I will provide
for myself and child. I leave him as
free as I am determined to be myself&mdash;he
shall be answerable for no debts of
mine.'</p>

<p>"Astonishment closed their lips, till
Mr. Venables, gently pushing his
friend, with a forced smile, out of the
room, nature for a moment prevailed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-57" id="Pg_2-57"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-57.png">57</a>]</span>
and, appearing like himself, he turned
round, burning with rage, to me:
but there was no terror in the frown,
excepting when contrasted with the
malignant smile which preceded it.
He bade me 'leave the house at my
peril; told me he despised my threats;
I had no resource; I could not swear the
peace against him!&mdash;I was not afraid of
my life!&mdash;he had never struck me!'</p>

<p>"He threw the letter in the fire,
which I had incautiously left in his
hands; and, quitting the room, locked
the door on me.</p>

<p>"When left alone, I was a moment
or two before I could recollect myself.
One scene had succeeded another with
such rapidity, I almost doubted whether
I was reflecting on a real event.
'Was it possible? Was I, indeed,
free?'&mdash;Yes; free I termed myself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-58" id="Pg_2-58"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-58.png">58</a>]</span>
when I decidedly perceived the conduct
I ought to adopt. How had I panted
for liberty&mdash;liberty, that I would have
purchased at any price, but that of my
own esteem! I rose, and shook myself;
opened the window, and methought
the air never smelled so sweet. The face
of heaven grew fairer as I viewed it,
and the clouds seemed to flit away obedient
to my wishes, to give my soul
room to expand. I was all soul, and
(wild as it may appear) felt as if I
could have dissolved in the soft balmy
gale that kissed my cheek, or have
glided below the horizon on the glowing,
descending beams. A seraphic satisfaction
animated, without agitating
my spirits; and my imagination collected,
in visions sublimely terrible, or
soothingly beautiful, an immense variety
of the endless images, which nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-59" id="Pg_2-59"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-59.png">59</a>]</span>
affords, and fancy combines, of the
grand and fair. The lustre of these
bright picturesque sketches faded with
the setting sun; but I was still alive to
the calm delight they had diffused
through my heart.</p>

<p>"There may be advocates for matrimonial
obedience, who, making a distinction
between the duty of a wife and
of a human being, may blame my conduct.&mdash;To
them I write not&mdash;my feelings
are not for them to analyze; and
may you, my child, never be able to
ascertain, by heart-rending experience,
what your mother felt before the present
emancipation of her mind!</p>

<p>"I began to write a letter to my father,
after closing one to my uncle;
not to ask advice, but to signify my determination;
when I was interrupted
by the entrance of Mr. Venables. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-60" id="Pg_2-60"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-60.png">60</a>]</span>
manner was changed. His views on
my uncle's fortune made him averse to
my quitting his house, or he would, I
am convinced, have been glad to have
shaken off even the slight restraint my
presence imposed on him; the restraint
of showing me some respect. So far
from having an affection for me, he
really hated me, because he was convinced
that I must despise him.</p>

<p>"He told me, that, 'As I now had
had time to cool and reflect, he did not
doubt but that my prudence, and nice
sense of propriety, would lead me to
overlook what was passed.'</p>

<p>"'Reflection,' I replied, 'had only
confirmed my purpose, and no power
on earth could divert me from it.'</p>

<p>"Endeavouring to assume a soothing
voice and look, when he would willingly
have tortured me, to force me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-61" id="Pg_2-61"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-61.png">61</a>]</span>
feel his power, his countenance had an
infernal expression, when he desired me,
'Not to expose myself to the servants,
by obliging him to confine me in my
apartment; if then I would give my
promise not to quit the house precipitately,
I should be free&mdash;and&mdash;.' I declared,
interrupting him, 'that I would
promise nothing. I had no measures
to keep with him&mdash;I was resolved, and
would not condescend to subterfuge.'</p>

<p>"He muttered, 'that I should soon
repent of these preposterous airs;' and,
ordering tea to be carried into my little
study, which had a communication with
my bed-chamber, he once more locked
the door upon me, and left me to my
own meditations. I had passively followed
him up stairs, not wishing to fatigue
myself with unavailing exertion.</p>

<p>"Nothing calms the mind like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-62" id="Pg_2-62"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-62.png">62</a>]</span>
fixed purpose. I felt as if I had heaved
a thousand weight from my heart; the
atmosphere seemed lightened; and, if
I execrated the institutions of society,
which thus enable men to tyrannize
over women, it was almost a disinterested
sentiment. I disregarded present
inconveniences, when my mind had
done struggling with itself,&mdash;when reason
and inclination had shaken hands
and were at peace. I had no longer
the cruel task before me, in endless perspective,
aye, during the tedious
for ever of life, of labouring to
overcome my repugnance&mdash;of labouring
to extinguish the hopes, the maybes
of a lively imagination. Death I
had hailed as my only chance for deliverance;
but, while existence had still
so many charms, and life promised
happiness, I shrunk from the icy arms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-63" id="Pg_2-63"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-63.png">63</a>]</span>
of an unknown tyrant, though far more
inviting than those of the man, to whom I
supposed myself bound without any other
alternative; and was content to linger
a little longer, waiting for I knew not
what, rather than leave 'the warm
precincts of the cheerful day,' and all
the unenjoyed affection of my nature.</p>

<p>"My present situation gave a new
turn to my reflection; and I wondered
(now the film seemed to be withdrawn,
that obscured the piercing sight of reason)
how I could, previously to the deciding
outrage, have considered myself
as everlastingly united to vice and folly?
'Had an evil genius cast a spell at my
birth; or a demon stalked out of chaos,
to perplex my understanding, and enchain
my will, with delusive prejudices?'</p>

<p>"I pursued this train of thinking; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-64" id="Pg_2-64"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-64.png">64</a>]</span>
led me out of myself, to expatiate on
the misery peculiar to my sex. 'Are
not,' I thought, 'the despots for ever
stigmatized, who, in the wantonness of
power, commanded even the most atrocious
criminals to be chained to dead
bodies? though surely those laws are
much more inhuman, which forge adamantine
fetters to bind minds together,
that never can mingle in social communion!
What indeed can equal the
wretchedness of that state, in which
there is no alternative, but to extinguish
the affections, or encounter infamy?'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XII" id="CHAP_XII"></a>CHAP. XII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Towards</span> midnight Mr. Venables
entered my chamber; and, with
calm audacity preparing to go to bed,
he bade me make haste, 'for that was
the best place for husbands and wives
to end their differences. He had been
drinking plentifully to aid his courage.</p>

<p>"I did not at first deign to reply.
But perceiving that he affected to take
my silence for consent, I told him that,
'If he would not go to another bed, or
allow me, I should sit up in my study
all night.' He attempted to pull me
into the chamber, half joking. But I
resisted; and, as he had determined not
to give me any reason for saying that
he used violence, after a few more ef<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-66" id="Pg_2-66"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-66.png">66</a>]</span>forts,
he retired, cursing my obstinacy,
to bed.</p>

<p>"I sat musing some time longer; then,
throwing my cloak around me, prepared
for sleep on a sopha. And, so fortunate
seemed my deliverance, so sacred
the pleasure of being thus wrapped up
in myself, that I slept profoundly, and
woke with a mind composed to encounter
the struggles of the day. Mr.
Venables did not wake till some hours
after; and then he came to me half-dressed,
yawning and stretching, with
haggard eyes, as if he scarcely recollected
what had passed the preceding
evening. He fixed his eyes on me for
a moment, then, calling me a fool,
asked 'How long I intended to continue
this pretty farce? For his part, he
was devilish sick of it; but this was the
plague of marrying women who pretended
to know something.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-67" id="Pg_2-67"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-67.png">67</a>]</span>
"I made no other reply to this harangue,
than to say, 'That he ought to
be glad to get rid of a woman so unfit
to be his companion&mdash;and that any
change in my conduct would be mean
dissimulation; for maturer reflection
only gave the sacred seal of reason to
my first resolution.'</p>

<p>"He looked as if he could have
stamped with impatience, at being
obliged to stifle his rage; but, conquering
his anger (for weak people, whose
passions seem the most ungovernable,
restrain them with the greatest ease,
when they have a sufficient motive), he
exclaimed, 'Very pretty, upon my
soul! very pretty, theatrical flourishes!
Pray, fair Roxana, stoop from your altitudes,
and remember that you are
acting a part in real life.'</p>

<p>"He uttered this speech with a self-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-68" id="Pg_2-68"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-68.png">68</a>]</span>satisfied
air, and went down stairs to
dress.</p>

<p>"In about an hour he came to me
again; and in the same tone said, 'That
he came as my gentleman-usher to hand
me down to breakfast.</p>

<p>"'Of the black rod?' asked I.</p>

<p>"This question, and the tone in
which I asked it, a little disconcerted
him. To say the truth, I now felt no
resentment; my firm resolution to free
myself from my ignoble thraldom, had
absorbed the various emotions which,
during six years, had racked my soul.
The duty pointed out by my principles
seemed clear; and not one tender feeling
intruded to make me swerve: The
dislike which my husband had inspired
was strong; but it only led me to wish
to avoid, to wish to let him drop out of
my memory; there was no misery, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-69" id="Pg_2-69"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-69.png">69</a>]</span>
torture that I would not deliberately
have chosen, rather than renew my
lease of servitude.</p>

<p>"During the breakfast, he attempted
to reason with me on the folly of romantic
sentiments; for this was the indiscriminate
epithet he gave to every
mode of conduct or thinking superior
to his own. He asserted, 'that all the
world were governed by their own interest;
those who pretended to be actuated
by different motives, were only
deeper knaves, or fools crazed by books,
who took for gospel all the rodomantade
nonsense written by men who
knew nothing of the world. For his
part, he thanked God, he was no hypocrite;
and, if he stretched a point
sometimes, it was always with an intention
of paying every man his own.'</p>

<p>"He then artfully insinuated, 'that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-70" id="Pg_2-70"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-70.png">70</a>]</span>
he daily expected a vessel to arrive, a
successful speculation, that would make
him easy for the present, and that he
had several other schemes actually depending,
that could not fail. He had
no doubt of becoming rich in a few
years, though he had been thrown back
by some unlucky adventures at the setting
out.'</p>

<p>"I mildly replied, 'That I wished he
might not involve himself still deeper.'</p>

<p>"He had no notion that I was governed
by a decision of judgment, not
to be compared with a mere spurt of
resentment. He knew not what it was
to feel indignation against vice, and
often boasted of his placable temper,
and readiness to forgive injuries. True;
for he only considered the being deceived,
as an effort of skill he had not
guarded against; and then, with a cant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-71" id="Pg_2-71"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-71.png">71</a>]</span>
of candour, would observe, 'that he
did not know how he might himself
have been tempted to act in the same
circumstances.' And, as his heart
never opened to friendship, it never was
wounded by disappointment. Every
new acquaintance he protested, it is
true, was 'the cleverest fellow in the
world;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins> and he really thought so; till
the novelty of his conversation or manners
ceased to have any effect on his
sluggish spirits. His respect for rank or
fortune was more permanent, though
he chanced to have no design of availing
himself of the influence of either
to promote his own views.</p>

<p>"After a prefatory conversation,&mdash;my
blood (I thought it had been cooler)
flushed over my whole countenance as
he spoke&mdash;he alluded to my situation.
He desired me to reflect&mdash;'and act like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-72" id="Pg_2-72"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-72.png">72</a>]</span>
a prudent woman, as the best proof of
my superior understanding; for he must
own I had sense, did I know how to
use it. I was not,' he laid a stress on
his words, 'without my passions; and
a husband was a convenient cloke.&mdash;He
was liberal in his way of thinking;
and why might not we, like many other
married people, who were above vulgar
prejudices, tacitly consent to let
each other follow their own inclination?&mdash;He
meant nothing more, in the
letter I made the ground of complaint;
and the pleasure which I seemed to
take in Mr. S.'s company, led him to
conclude, that he was not disagreeable
to me.'</p>

<p>"A clerk brought in the letters of
the day, and I, as I often did, while
he was discussing subjects of business,
went to the <i>piano forte</i>, and began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-73" id="Pg_2-73"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-73.png">73</a>]</span>
play a favourite air to restore myself,
as it were, to nature, and drive the
sophisticated sentiments I had just been
obliged to listen to, out of my soul.</p>

<p>"They had excited sensations similar
to those I have felt, in viewing the squalid
inhabitants of some of the lanes and
back streets of the metropolis, mortified
at being compelled to consider
them as my fellow-creatures, as if an
ape had claimed kindred with me. Or,
as when surrounded by a mephitical fog,
I have wished to have a volley of cannon
fired, to clear the incumbered atmosphere,
and give me room to breathe
and move.</p>

<p>"My spirits were all in arms, and I
played a kind of extemporary prelude.
The cadence was probably wild and
impassioned, while, lost in thought, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-74" id="Pg_2-74"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-74.png">74</a>]</span>
made the sounds a kind of echo to my
train of thinking.</p>

<p>"Pausing for a moment, I met Mr.
Venables' eyes. He was observing me
with an air of conceited satisfaction, as
much as to say&mdash;'My last insinuation
has done the business&mdash;she begins to
know her own interest.' Then gathering
up his letters, he said, 'That
he hoped he should hear no more romantic
stuff, well enough in a miss
just come from boarding school;' and
went, as was his custom, to the counting-house.
I still continued playing;
and, turning to a sprightly lesson, I
executed it with uncommon vivacity.
I heard footsteps approach the door,
and was soon convinced that Mr. Venables
was listening; the consciousness
only gave more animation to my
fingers. He went down into the kit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-75" id="Pg_2-75"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-75.png">75</a>]</span>chen,
and the cook, probably by his
desire, came to me, to know what I
would please to order for dinner. Mr.
Venables came into the parlour again,
with apparent carelessness. I perceived
that the cunning man was over-reaching
himself; and I gave my directions
as usual, and left the room.</p>

<p>"While I was making some alteration
in my dress, Mr. Venables peeped
in, and, begging my pardon for interrupting
me, disappeared. I took
up some work (I could not read), and
two or three messages were sent to me,
probably for no other purpose, but to
enable Mr. Venables to ascertain what
I was about.</p>

<p>"I listened whenever I heard the
street-door open; at last I imagined I
could distinguish Mr. Venables' step,
going out. I laid aside my work; my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-76" id="Pg_2-76"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-76.png">76</a>]</span>
heart palpitated; still I was afraid
hastily to enquire; and I waited a long
half hour, before I ventured to ask the
boy whether his master was in the
counting-house?</p>

<p>"Being answered in the negative,
I bade him call me a coach, and collecting
a few necessaries hastily together,
with a little parcel of letters and
papers which I had collected the preceding
evening, I hurried into it, desiring
the coachman to drive to a distant
part of the town.</p>

<p>"I almost feared that the coach
would break down before I got out of
the street; and, when I turned the
corner, I seemed to breathe a freer air.
I was ready to imagine that I was rising
above the thick atmosphere of earth;
or I felt, as wearied souls might be sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-77" id="Pg_2-77"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-77.png">77</a>]</span>posed
to feel on entering another state
of existence.</p>

<p>"I stopped at one or two stands of
coaches to elude pursuit, and then
drove round the skirts of the town to
seek for an obscure lodging, where I
wished to remain concealed, till I could
avail myself of my uncle's protection.
I had resolved to assume my own name
immediately, and openly to avow my
determination, without any formal vindication,
the moment I had found a
home, in which I could rest free from
the daily alarm of expecting to see
Mr. Venables enter.</p>

<p>"I looked at several lodgings; but
finding that I could not, without a reference
to some acquaintance, who
might inform my tyrant, get admittance
into a decent apartment&mdash;men
have not all this trouble&mdash;I thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-78" id="Pg_2-78"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-78.png">78</a>]</span>
a woman whom I had assisted to furnish
a little haberdasher's shop, and
who I knew had a first floor to let.</p>

<p>"I went to her, and though I could
not persuade her, that the quarrel between
me and Mr. Venables would
never be made up, still she agreed to
conceal me for the present; yet assuring
me at the same time, shaking her
head, that, when a woman was once
married, she must bear every thing.
Her pale face, on which appeared a
thousand haggard lines and delving
wrinkles, produced by what is emphatically
termed fretting, inforced
her remark; and I had afterwards an
opportunity of observing the treatment
she had to endure, which grizzled her
into patience. She toiled from morning
till night; yet her husband would rob
the till, and take away the money re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-79" id="Pg_2-79"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-79.png">79</a>]</span>served
for paying bills; and, returning
home drunk, he would beat her if she
chanced to offend him, though she had
a child at the breast.</p>

<p>"These scenes awoke me at night;
and, in the morning, I heard her, as
usual, talk to her dear Johnny&mdash;he,
forsooth, was her master; no slave in
the West Indies had one more despotic;
but fortunately she was of the
true Russian breed of wives.</p>

<p>"My mind, during the few past
days, seemed, as it were, disengaged
from my body; but, now the struggle
was over, I felt very forcibly the effect
which perturbation of spirits produces
on a woman in my situation.</p>

<p>"The apprehension of a miscarriage,
obliged me to confine myself to
my apartment near a fortnight; but
I wrote to my uncle's friend for money,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-80" id="Pg_2-80"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-80.png">80</a>]</span>
promising 'to call on him, and explain
my situation, when I was well enough
to go out; mean time I earnestly intreated
him, not to mention my place of
abode to any one, lest my husband&mdash;such
the law considered him&mdash;should
disturb the mind he could not conquer.
I mentioned my intention of setting out
for Lisbon, to claim my uncle's protection,
the moment my health would
permit.'</p>

<p>"The tranquillity however, which
I was recovering, was soon interrupted.
My landlady came up to me one
day, with eyes swollen with weeping,
unable to utter what she was commanded
to say. She declared, 'That
she was never so miserable in her life;
that she must appear an ungrateful
monster; and that she would readily
go down on her knees to me, to intreat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-81" id="Pg_2-81"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-81.png">81</a>]</span>
me to forgive her, as she had done to
her husband to spare her the cruel
task.' Sobs prevented her from proceeding,
or answering my impatient
enquiries, to know what she meant.</p>

<p>"When she became a little more
composed, she took a newspaper out of
her pocket, declaring, 'that her heart
smote her, but what could she do?&mdash;she
must obey her husband.' I snatched
the paper from her. An advertisement
quickly met my eye, purporting,
that 'Maria Venables had, without
any assignable cause, absconded from
her husband; and any person harbouring
her, was menaced with the utmost
severity of the law.'</p>

<p>"Perfectly acquainted with Mr.
Venables' meanness of soul, this step
did not excite my surprise, and scarcely
my contempt. Resentment in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-82" id="Pg_2-82"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-82.png">82</a>]</span>
breast, never survived love. I bade
the poor woman, in a kind tone, wipe
her eyes, and request her husband to
come up, and speak to me himself.</p>

<p>"My manner awed him. He respected
a lady, though not a woman;
and began to mutter out an apology.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Venables was a rich gentleman;
he wished to oblige me, but he
had suffered enough by the law already,
to tremble at the thought;
besides, for certain, we should come
together again, and then even I should
not thank him for being accessary to
keeping us asunder.&mdash;A husband and
wife were, God knows, just as one,&mdash;and
all would come round at last.' He
uttered a drawling 'Hem!' and then
with an arch look, added&mdash;'Master
might have had his little frolics&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-83" id="Pg_2-83"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-83.png">83</a>]</span>&mdash;Lord
bless your heart!&mdash;men would
be men while the world stands.'</p>

<p>"To argue with this privileged first-born
of reason, I perceived, would be
vain. I therefore only requested him to
let me remain another day at his house,
while I sought for a lodging; and not
to inform Mr. Venables that I had ever
been sheltered there.</p>

<p>"He consented, because he had not
the courage to refuse a person for whom
he had an habitual respect; but I heard
the pent-up choler burst forth in curses,
when he met his wife, who was waiting
impatiently at the foot of the stairs,
to know what effect my expostulations
would have on him.</p>

<p>"Without wasting any time in the
fruitless indulgence of vexation, I once
more set out in search of an abode in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-84" id="Pg_2-84"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-84.png">84</a>]</span>
which I could hide myself for a few
weeks.</p>

<p>"Agreeing to pay an exorbitant
price, I hired an apartment, without
any reference being required relative
to my character: indeed, a glance
at my shape seemed to say, that my
motive for concealment was sufficiently
obvious. Thus was I obliged to shroud
my head in infamy.</p>

<p>"To avoid all danger of detection&mdash;I
use the appropriate word, my child,
for I was hunted out like a felon&mdash;I
determined to take possession of my
new lodgings that very evening.</p>

<p>"I did not inform my landlady
where I was going. I knew that she
had a sincere affection for me, and
would willingly have run any risk to
show her gratitude; yet I was fully convinced,
that a few kind words from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-85" id="Pg_2-85"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-85.png">85</a>]</span>
Johnny would have found the woman
in her, and her dear benefactress, as
she termed me in an agony of tears,
would have been sacrificed, to recompense
her tyrant for condescending to
treat her like an equal. He could be
kind-hearted, as she expressed it, when
he pleased. And this thawed sternness,
contrasted with his habitual brutality,
was the more acceptable, and
could not be purchased at too dear a
rate.</p>

<p>"The sight of the advertisement
made me desirous of taking refuge with
my uncle, let what would be the consequence;
and I repaired in a hackney
coach (afraid of meeting some person
who might chance to know me, had I
walked) to the chambers of my uncle's
friend.</p>

<p>"He received me with great polite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-86" id="Pg_2-86"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-86.png">86</a>]</span>ness
(my uncle had already prepossessed
him in my favour), and listened, with
interest, to my explanation of the
motives which had induced me to fly
from home, and skulk in obscurity,
with all the timidity of fear that ought
only to be the companion of guilt. He
lamented, with rather more gallantry
than, in my situation, I thought delicate,
that such a woman should be
thrown away on a man insensible to the
charms of beauty or grace. He seemed
at a loss what to advise me to do, to
evade my husband's search, without
hastening to my uncle, whom, he hesitating
said, I might not find alive. He
uttered this intelligence with visible
regret; requested me, at least, to wait
for the arrival of the next packet; offered
me what money I wanted, and
promised to visit me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-87" id="Pg_2-87"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-87.png">87</a>]</span>
"He kept his word; still no letter
arrived to put an end to my painful
state of suspense. I procured some
books and music, to beguile the tedious
solitary days.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Come, ever smiling Liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And with thee bring thy jocund train:'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I sung&mdash;and sung till, saddened by the
strain of joy, I bitterly lamented the
fate that deprived me of all social pleasure.
Comparative liberty indeed I
had possessed myself of; but the jocund
train lagged far behind!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIII" id="CHAP_XIII"></a>CHAP. XIII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">By</span> watching my only visitor, my
uncle's friend, or by some other means,
Mr. Venables discovered my residence,
and came to enquire for me. The
maid-servant assured him there was no
such person in the house. A bustle
ensued&mdash;I caught the alarm&mdash;listened&mdash;distinguished
his voice, and immediately
locked the door. They suddenly
grew still; and I waited near a
quarter of an hour, before I heard him
open the parlour door, and mount the
stairs with the mistress of the house,
who obsequiously declared that she
knew nothing of me.</p>

<p>"Finding my door locked, she requested
me to 'open it, and prepare to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-89" id="Pg_2-89"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-89.png">89</a>]</span>
go home with my husband, poor gentleman!
to whom I had already occasioned
sufficient vexation.' I made no
reply. Mr. Venables then, in an assumed
tone of softness, intreated me,
'to consider what he suffered, and my
own reputation, and get the better of
childish resentment.' He ran on in
the same strain, pretending to address
me, but evidently adapting his discourse
to the capacity of the landlady;
who, at every pause, uttered an exclamation
of pity; or 'Yes, to be sure&mdash;Very
true, sir.'</p>

<p>"Sick of the farce, and perceiving
that I could not avoid the hated interview,
I opened the door, and he entered.
Advancing with easy assurance
to take my hand, I shrunk from his
touch, with an involuntary start, as I
should have done from a noisome reptile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-90" id="Pg_2-90"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-90.png">90</a>]</span>
with more disgust than terror. His
conductress was retiring, to give us, as
she said, an opportunity to accommodate
matters. But I bade her come in,
or I would go out; and curiosity impelled
her to obey me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables began to expostulate;
and this woman, proud of his
confidence, to second him. But I
calmly silenced her, in the midst of a
vulgar harangue, and turning to him,
asked, 'Why he vainly tormented me?
declaring that no power on earth
should force me back to his house.'</p>

<p>"After a long altercation, the particulars
of which, it would be to no
purpose to repeat, he left the room.
Some time was spent in loud conversation
in the parlour below, and I
discovered that he had brought his
friend, an attorney, with him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-91" id="Pg_2-91"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-91.png">91</a>]</span></p>
<p class="sp">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>*&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The tumult on the landing
place, brought out a gentleman, who
had recently taken apartments in the
house; he enquired why I was thus
assailed<a name="FNanchor_91-A_7" id="FNanchor_91-A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_91-A_7" class="fnanchor">[91-A]</a>? The voluble attorney instantly
repeated the trite tale. The
stranger turned to me, observing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-92" id="Pg_2-92"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-92.png">92</a>]</span>
with the most soothing politeness and
manly interest, that 'my countenance
told a very different story.' He added,
'that I should not be insulted, or
forced out of the house, by any body.'</p>

<p>"'Not by her husband?' asked the
attorney.</p>

<p>"'No, sir, not by her husband.' Mr.
Venables advanced towards him&mdash;But
there was a decision in his attitude,
that so well seconded that of his voice,</p>
<p class="sp">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p class="sp">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>*&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; They left the house: at
the same time protesting, that any one
that should dare to protect me, should
be prosecuted with the utmost rigour.</p>

<p>"They were scarcely out of the
house, when my landlady came up to
me again, and begged my pardon, in
a very different tone. For, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-93" id="Pg_2-93"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-93.png">93</a>]</span>
Mr. Venables had bid her, at her peril,
harbour me, he had not attended, I
found, to her broad hints, to discharge
the lodging. I instantly promised to
pay her, and make her a present to
compensate for my abrupt departure,
if she would procure me another lodging,
at a sufficient distance; and she, in
return, repeating Mr. Venables' plausible
tale, I raised her indignation, and
excited her sympathy, by telling her
briefly the truth.</p>

<p>"She expressed her commiseration
with such honest warmth, that I felt
soothed; for I have none of that fastidious
sensitiveness, which a vulgar accent
or gesture can alarm to the disregard
of real kindness. I was ever glad
to perceive in others the humane feelings
I delighted to exercise; and the
recollection of some ridiculous charac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-94" id="Pg_2-94"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-94.png">94</a>]</span>teristic
circumstances, which have occurred
in a moment of emotion, has
convulsed me with laughter, though
at the instant I should have thought it
sacrilegious to have smiled. Your improvement,
my dearest girl, being ever
present to me while I write, I note
these feelings, because women, more
accustomed to observe manners than
actions, are too much alive to ridicule.
So much so, that their boasted sensibility
is often stifled by false delicacy.
True sensibility, the sensibility which
is the auxiliary of virtue, and the soul
of genius, is in society so occupied
with the feelings of others, as scarcely
to regard its own sensations. With
what reverence have I looked up at my
uncle, the dear parent of my mind!
when I have seen the sense of his own
sufferings, of mind and body, absorbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-95" id="Pg_2-95"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-95.png">95</a>]</span>
in a desire to comfort those, whose misfortunes
were comparatively trivial.
He would have been ashamed of being
as indulgent to himself, as he was to
others. 'Genuine fortitude,' he would
assert, 'consisted in governing our own
emotions, and making allowance for
the weaknesses in our friends, that we
would not tolerate in ourselves.' But
where is my fond regret leading me!</p>

<p>"'Women must be submissive,' said
my landlady. 'Indeed what could
most women do? Who had they to
maintain them, but their husbands?
Every woman, and especially a lady,
could not go through rough and
smooth, as she had done, to earn a little
bread.'</p>

<p>"She was in a talking mood, and
proceeded to inform me how she had
been used in the world. 'She knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-96" id="Pg_2-96"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-96.png">96</a>]</span>
what it was to have a bad husband, or
she did not know who should.' I perceived
that she would be very much
mortified, were I not to attend to her
tale, and I did not attempt to interrupt
her, though I wished her, as soon
as possible, to go out in search of a new
abode for me, where I could once more
hide my head.</p>

<p>"She began by telling me, 'That
she had saved a little money in service;
and was over-persuaded (we must all
be in love once in our lives) to marry a
likely man, a footman in the family,
not worth a groat. My plan,' she continued,
'was to take a house, and let
out lodgings; and all went on well,
till my husband got acquainted with
an impudent slut, who chose to live on
other people's means&mdash;and then all
went to rack and ruin. He ran in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-97" id="Pg_2-97"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-97.png">97</a>]</span>
debt to buy her fine clothes, such
clothes as I never thought of wearing
myself, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;he
signed an execution on my very
goods, bought with the money I
worked so hard to get; and they came
and took my bed from under me, before
I heard a word of the matter.
Aye, madam, these are misfortunes
that you gentlefolks know nothing of,&mdash;but
sorrow is sorrow, let it come
which way it will.</p>

<p>"'I sought for a service again&mdash;very
hard, after having a house of my own!&mdash;but
he used to follow me, and kick up
such a riot when he was drunk, that I
could not keep a place; nay, he even
stole my clothes, and pawned them;
and when I went to the pawnbroker's,
and offered to take my oath that they
were not bought with a farthing of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-98" id="Pg_2-98"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-98.png">98</a>]</span>
money, they said, 'It was all as one,
my husband had a right to whatever I
had.'</p>

<p>"'At last he listed for a soldier, and
I took a house, making an agreement
to pay for the furniture by degrees;
and I almost starved myself, till I once
more got before-hand in the world.</p>

<p>"'After an absence of six years
(God forgive me! I thought he was
dead) my husband returned; found me
out, and came with such a penitent
face, I forgave him, and clothed him
from head to foot. But he had not
been a week in the house, before some
of his creditors arrested him; and, he
selling my goods, I found myself once
more reduced to beggary; for I was
not as well able to work, go to bed
late, and rise early, as when I quitted
service; and then I thought it hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-99" id="Pg_2-99"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-99.png">99</a>]</span>
enough. He was soon tired of me,
when there was nothing more to be
had, and left me again.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins>I will not tell you how I was buffeted
about, till, hearing for certain
that he had died in an hospital abroad,
I once more returned to my old occupation;
but have not yet been able to
get my head above water: so, madam,
you must not be angry if I am afraid to
run any risk, when I know so well,
that women have always the worst of
it, when law is to decide.'</p>

<p>"After uttering a few more complaints,
I prevailed on my landlady to
go out in quest of a lodging; and, to
be more secure, I condescended to the
mean shift of changing my name.</p>

<p>"But why should I dwell on similar
incidents!&mdash;I was hunted, like an infected
beast, from three different apartments,
and should not have been al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-100" id="Pg_2-100"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-100.png">100</a>]</span>lowed
to rest in any, had not Mr. Venables,
informed of my uncle's dangerous
state of health, been inspired with
the fear of hurrying me out of the
world as I advanced in my pregnancy,
by thus tormenting and obliging me to
take sudden journeys to avoid him; and
then his speculations on my uncle's fortune
must prove abortive.</p>

<p>"One day, when he had pursued me
to an inn, I fainted, hurrying from him;
and, falling down, the sight of my blood
alarmed him, and obtained a respite for
me. It is strange that he should have
retained any hope, after observing my
unwavering determination; but, from
the mildness of my behaviour, when I
found all my endeavours to change his
disposition unavailing, he formed an
erroneous opinion of my character, imagining
that, were we once more together,
I should part with the money he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-101" id="Pg_2-101"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-101.png">101</a>]</span>
could not legally force from me, with
the same facility as formerly. My forbearance
and occasional sympathy he
had mistaken for weakness of character;
and, because he perceived that I
disliked resistance, he thought my indulgence
and compassion mere selfishness,
and never discovered that the fear of
being unjust, or of unnecessarily wounding
the feelings of another, was much
more painful to me, than any thing I
could have to endure myself. Perhaps
it was pride which made me imagine,
that I could bear what I dreaded to inflict;
and that it was often easier to suffer,
than to see the sufferings of others.</p>

<p>"I forgot to mention that, during
this persecution, I received a letter
from my uncle, informing me, 'that
he only found relief from continual
change of air; and that he intended to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-102" id="Pg_2-102"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-102.png">102</a>]</span>
return when the spring was a little more
advanced (it was now the middle of
February), and then we would plan a
journey to Italy, leaving the fogs and
cares of England far behind.' He approved
of my conduct, promised to
adopt my child, and seemed to have
no doubt of obliging Mr. Venables to
hear reason. He wrote to his friend,
by the same post, desiring him to call
on Mr. Venables in his name; and, in
consequence of the remonstrances he
dictated, I was permitted to lie-in tranquilly.</p>

<p>"The two or three weeks previous, I
had been allowed to rest in peace; but,
so accustomed was I to pursuit and
alarm, that I seldom closed my eyes
without being haunted by Mr. Venables'
image, who seemed to assume terrific or
hateful forms to torment me, wherever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-103" id="Pg_2-103"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-103.png">103</a>]</span>
I turned.&mdash;Sometimes a wild cat, a
roaring bull, or hideous assassin, whom
I vainly attempted to fly; at others he
was a demon, hurrying me to the brink
of a precipice, plunging me into dark
waves, or horrid gulfs; and I woke,
in violent fits of trembling anxiety, to
assure myself that it was all a dream,
and to endeavour to lure my waking
thoughts to wander to the delightful
Italian vales, I hoped soon to visit; or
to picture some august ruins, where I
reclined in fancy on a mouldering column,
and escaped, in the contemplation
of the heart-enlarging virtues of antiquity,
from the turmoil of cares that
had depressed all the daring purposes
of my soul. But I was not long allowed
to calm my mind by the exercise
of my imagination; for the third
day after your birth, my child, I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-104" id="Pg_2-104"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-104.png">104</a>]</span>
surprised by a visit from my elder brother;
who came in the most abrupt
manner, to inform me of the death of
my uncle. He had left the greater
part of his fortune to my child, appointing
me its guardian; in short,
every step was taken to enable me to
be mistress of his fortune, without putting
any part of it in Mr. Venables'
power. My brother came to vent his
rage on me, for having, as he expressed
himself, 'deprived him, my uncle's
eldest nephew, of his inheritance;'
though my uncle's property, the fruit
of his own exertion, being all in the
funds, or on landed securities, there
was not a shadow of justice in the
charge.</p>

<p>"As I sincerely loved my uncle, this
intelligence brought on a fever, which
I struggled to conquer with all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-105" id="Pg_2-105"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-105.png">105</a>]</span>
energy of my mind; for, in my desolate
state, I had it very much at heart to
suckle you, my poor babe. You
seemed my only tie to life, a cherub,
to whom I wished to be a father, as
well as a mother; and the double duty
appeared to me to produce a proportionate
increase of affection. But the
pleasure I felt, while sustaining you,
snatched from the wreck of hope, was
cruelly damped by melancholy reflections
on my widowed state&mdash;widowed
by the death of my uncle. Of Mr.
Venables I thought not, even when I
thought of the felicity of loving your
father, and how a mother's pleasure
might be exalted, and her care softened
by a husband's tenderness.&mdash;'Ought to
be!' I exclaimed; and I endeavoured
to drive away the tenderness that suffo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-106" id="Pg_2-106"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-106.png">106</a>]</span>cated
me; but my spirits were weak,
and the unbidden tears would flow.
'Why was I,' I would ask thee, but
thou didst not heed me,&mdash;'cut off from
the participation of the sweetest pleasure
of life?' I imagined with what
extacy, after the pains of child-bed, I
should have presented my little stranger,
whom I had so long wished to view, to
a respectable father, and with what
maternal fondness I should have pressed
them both to my heart!&mdash;Now I kissed
her with less delight, though with the
most endearing compassion, poor helpless
one! when I perceived a slight resemblance
of him, to whom she owed
her existence; or, if any gesture reminded
me of him, even in his best
days, my heart heaved, and I pressed
the innocent to my bosom, as if to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-107" id="Pg_2-107"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-107.png">107</a>]</span>
purify it&mdash;yes, I blushed to think that
its purity had been sullied, by allowing
such a man to be its father.</p>

<p>"After my recovery, I began to
think of taking a house in the country,
or of making an excursion on the continent,
to avoid Mr. Venables; and to
open my heart to new pleasures and
affection. The spring was melting into
summer, and you, my little companion,
began to smile&mdash;that smile
made hope bud out afresh, assuring me
the world was not a desert. Your
gestures were ever present to my
fancy; and I dwelt on the joy I should
feel when you would begin to walk and
lisp. Watching your wakening mind,
and shielding from every rude blast
my tender blossom, I recovered my
spirits&mdash;I dreamed not of the frost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-108" id="Pg_2-108"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-108.png">108</a>]</span>&mdash;'the
killing frost,' to which you were
destined to be exposed.&mdash;But I lose all
patience&mdash;and execrate the injustice
of the world&mdash;folly! ignorance!&mdash;I
should rather call it; but, shut up from
a free circulation of thought, and always
pondering on the same griefs, I
writhe under the torturing apprehensions,
which ought to excite only
honest indignation, or active compassion;
and would, could I view them
as the natural consequence of things.
But, born a woman&mdash;and born to suffer,
in endeavouring to repress my own
emotions, I feel more acutely the various
ills my sex are fated to bear&mdash;I
feel that the evils they are subject to
endure, degrade them so far below
their oppressors, as almost to justify
their tyranny; leading at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-109" id="Pg_2-109"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-109.png">109</a>]</span>
time superficial reasoners to term that
weakness the cause, which is only
the consequence of short-sighted despotism.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIV" id="CHAP_XIV"></a>CHAP. XIV.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">As</span> my mind grew calmer, the
visions of Italy again returned with
their former glow of colouring; and I
resolved on quitting the kingdom for
a time, in search of the cheerfulness,
that naturally results from a change of
scene, unless we carry the barbed arrow
with us, and only see what we
feel.</p>

<p>"During the period necessary to
prepare for a long absence, I sent a
supply to pay my father's debts, and
settled my brothers in eligible situations;
but my attention was not
wholly engrossed by my family, though
I do not think it necessary to enumerate
the common exertions of huma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-111" id="Pg_2-111"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-111.png">111</a>]</span>nity.
The manner in which my uncle's
property was settled, prevented
me from making the addition to the
fortune of my surviving sister, that I
could have wished; but I had prevailed
on him to bequeath her two
thousand pounds, and she determined
to marry a lover, to whom she had
been some time attached. Had it not
been for this engagement, I should have
invited her to accompany me in my
tour; and I might have escaped the
pit, so artfully dug in my path, when
I was the least aware of danger.</p>

<p>"I had thought of remaining in
England, till I weaned my child; but
this state of freedom was too peaceful
to last, and I had soon reason to wish
to hasten my departure. A friend of
Mr. Venables, the same attorney who
had accompanied him in several excur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-112" id="Pg_2-112"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-112.png">112</a>]</span>sions
to hunt me from my hiding places,
waited on me to propose a reconciliation.
On my refusal, he indirectly
advised me to make over to my husband&mdash;for
husband he would term
him&mdash;the greater part of the property
I had at command, menacing me with
continual persecution unless I complied,
and that, as a last resort, he
would claim the child. I did not,
though intimidated by the last insinuation,
scruple to declare, that I would
not allow him to squander the money
left to me for far different purposes,
but offered him five hundred pounds, if
he would sign a bond not to torment
me any more. My maternal anxiety
made me thus appear to waver from
my first determination, and probably
suggested to him, or his diabolical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-113" id="Pg_2-113"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-113.png">113</a>]</span>
agent, the infernal plot, which has
succeeded but too well.</p>

<p>"The bond was executed; still I
was impatient to leave England. Mischief
hung in the air when we breathed
the same; I wanted seas to divide
us, and waters to roll between, till he
had forgotten that I had the means of
helping him through a new scheme.
Disturbed by the late occurrences, I instantly
prepared for my departure.
My only delay was waiting for a maid-servant,
who spoke French fluently,
and had been warmly recommended to
me. A valet I was advised to hire,
when I fixed on my place of residence
for any time.</p>

<p>"My God, with what a light heart
did I set out for Dover!&mdash;It was not my
country, but my cares, that I was leaving
behind. My heart seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-114" id="Pg_2-114"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-114.png">114</a>]</span>
bound with the wheels, or rather appeared
the centre on which they twirled.
I clasped you to my bosom, exclaiming
'And you will be safe&mdash;quite
safe&mdash;when&mdash;we are once on
board the packet.&mdash;Would we were
there!' I smiled at my idle fears, as
the natural effect of continual alarm;
and I scarcely owned to myself that I
dreaded Mr. Venables's cunning, or
was conscious of the horrid delight he
would feel, at forming stratagem after
stratagem to circumvent me. I was
already in the snare&mdash;I never reached
the packet&mdash;I never saw thee more.&mdash;I
grow breathless. I have scarcely patience
to write down the details. The
maid&mdash;the plausible woman I had
hired&mdash;put, doubtless, some stupifying
potion in what I ate or drank, the
morning I left town. All I know is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-115" id="Pg_2-115"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-115.png">115</a>]</span>
that she must have quitted the chaise,
shameless wretch! and taken (from
my breast) my babe with her. How
could a creature in a female form see
me caress thee, and steal thee from my
arms! I must stop, stop to repress a
mother's anguish; left, in bitterness of
soul, I imprecate the wrath of heaven
on this tiger, who tore my only comfort
from me.</p>

<p>"How long I slept I know not;
certainly many hours, for I woke at the
close of day, in a strange confusion of
thought. I was probably roused to recollection
by some one thundering at a
huge, unwieldy gate. Attempting to
ask where I was, my voice died away,
and I tried to raise it in vain, as I have
done in a dream. I looked for my babe
with affright; feared that it had fallen
out of my lap, while I had so strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-116" id="Pg_2-116"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-116.png">116</a>]</span>ly
forgotten her; and, such was the
vague intoxication, I can give it no
other name, in which I was plunged,
I could not recollect when or where I
last saw you; but I sighed, as if my
heart wanted room to clear my head.</p>

<p>"The gates opened heavily, and
the sullen sound of many locks
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and and'">and</ins> bolts drawn back, grated on
my very soul, before I was appalled by
the creeking of the dismal hinges, as
they closed after me. The gloomy
pile was before me, half in ruins; some
of the aged trees of the avenue were
cut down, and left to rot where they
fell; and as we approached some
mouldering steps, a monstrous dog
darted forwards to the length of his
chain, and barked and growled infernally.</p>

<p>"The door was opened slowly, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-117" id="Pg_2-117"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-117.png">117</a>]</span>
a murderous visage peeped out, with a
lantern. 'Hush!' he uttered, in a
threatning tone, and the affrighted
animal stole back to his kennel. The
door of the chaise flew back, the
stranger put down the lantern, and
clasped his dreadful arms around me.
It was certainly the effect of the soporific
draught, for, instead of exerting
my strength, I sunk without motion,
though not without sense, on his shoulder,
my limbs refusing to obey my
will. I was carried up the steps into a
close-shut hall. A candle flaring in
the socket, scarcely dispersed the darkness,
though it displayed to me the
ferocious countenance of the wretch
who held me.</p>

<p>"He mounted a wide staircase.
Large figures painted on the walls
seemed to start on me, and glaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-118" id="Pg_2-118"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-118.png">118</a>]</span>
eyes to meet me at every turn. Entering
a long gallery, a dismal shriek made
me spring out of my conductor's arms,
with I know not what mysterious emotion
of terror; but I fell on the floor,
unable to sustain myself.</p>

<p>"A strange-looking female started
out of one of the recesses, and observed
me with more curiosity than interest;
till, sternly bid retire, she flitted back
like a shadow. Other faces, strongly
marked, or distorted, peeped through
the half-opened doors, and I heard
some incoherent sounds. I had no
distinct idea where I could be&mdash;I looked
on all sides, and almost doubted whether
I was alive or dead.</p>

<p>"Thrown on a bed, I immediately
sunk into insensibility again; and next
day, gradually recovering the use of
reason, I began, starting affrighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-119" id="Pg_2-119"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-119.png">119</a>]</span>
from the conviction, to discover where
I was confined&mdash;I insisted on seeing the
master of the mansion&mdash;I saw him&mdash;and
perceived that I was buried alive.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such, my child, are the events of
thy mother's life to this dreadful moment&mdash;Should
she ever escape from
the fangs of her enemies, she will add
the secrets of her prison-house&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XV" id="CHAP_XV"></a>CHAP. XV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Darnford</span> returned the memoirs
to Maria, with a most affectionate
letter, in which he reasoned on "the
absurdity of the laws respecting matrimony,
which, till divorces could be
more easily obtained, was," he declared,
"the most insufferable bondage. Ties of
this nature could not bind minds governed
by superior principles; and such
beings were privileged to act above the
dictates of laws they had no voice in
framing, if they had sufficient strength
of mind to endure the natural consequence.
In her case, to talk of duty,
was a farce, excepting what was due
to herself. Delicacy, as well as reason,
forbade her ever to think of returning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-124" id="Pg_2-124"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-124.png">124</a>]</span>
to her husband: was she then to restrain
her charming sensibility through
mere prejudice? These arguments
were not absolutely impartial, for he
disdained to conceal, that, when he
appealed to her reason, he felt that
he had some interest in her heart.&mdash;The
conviction was not more transporting,
than sacred&mdash;a thousand times a
day, he asked himself how he had merited
such happiness?&mdash;and as often he
determined to purify the heart she
deigned to inhabit&mdash;He intreated to be
again admitted to her presence."</p>

<p>He was; and the tear which glistened
in his eye, when he respectfully
pressed her to his bosom, rendered him
peculiarly dear to the unfortunate mother.
Grief had stilled the transports
of love, only to render their mutual
tenderness more touching. In former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-125" id="Pg_2-125"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-125.png">125</a>]</span>
interviews, Darnford had contrived, by
a hundred little pretexts, to sit near
her, to take her hand, or to meet her
eyes&mdash;now it was all soothing affection,
and esteem seemed to have rivalled
love. He adverted to her narrative,
and spoke with warmth of the oppression
she had endured.&mdash;His eyes, glowing
with a lambent flame, told her
how much he wished to restore her to
liberty and love; but he kissed her
hand, as if it had been that of a saint;
and spoke of the loss of her child, as if it
had been his own.&mdash;What could have
been more flattering to Maria?&mdash;Every
instance of self-denial was registered in
her heart, and she loved him, for loving
her too well to give way to the
transports of passion.</p>

<p>They met again and again; and
Darnford declared, while passion suf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-126" id="Pg_2-126"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-126.png">126</a>]</span>fused
his cheeks, that he never before
knew what it was to love.&mdash;</p>

<p>One morning Jemima informed
Maria, that her master intended to
wait on her, and speak to her without
witnesses. He came, and brought a
letter with him, pretending that he
was ignorant of its contents, though he
insisted on having it returned to him.
It was from the attorney already mentioned,
who informed her of the death
of her child, and hinted, "that she
could not now have a legitimate heir,
and that, would she make over the
half of her fortune during life, she
should be conveyed to Dover, and permitted
to pursue her plan of travelling."</p>

<p>Maria answered with warmth,
"That she had no terms to make with
the murderer of her babe, nor would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-127" id="Pg_2-127"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-127.png">127</a>]</span>
she purchase liberty at the price of her
own respect."</p>

<p>She began to expostulate with her
jailor; but he sternly bade her "Be
silent&mdash;he had not gone so far, not to
go further."</p>

<p>Darnford came in the evening.
Jemima was obliged to be absent, and
she, as usual, locked the door on them,
to prevent interruption or discovery.&mdash;The
lovers were, at first, embarrassed;
but fell insensibly into confidential discourse.
Darnford represented, "that
they might soon be parted," and wished
her "to put it out of the power of fate
to separate them."</p>

<p>As her husband she now received him,
and he solemnly pledged himself as her
protector&mdash;and eternal friend.&mdash;</p>

<p>There was one peculiarity in Maria's
mind: she was more anxious not
to deceive, than to guard against de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-128" id="Pg_2-128"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-128.png">128</a>]</span>ception;
and had rather trust without
sufficient reason, than be for ever the
prey of doubt. Besides, what are we,
when the mind has, from reflection, a
certain kind of elevation, which exalts
the contemplation above the little concerns
of prudence! We see what we
wish, and make a world of our own&mdash;and,
though reality may sometimes open
a door to misery, yet the moments of
happiness procured by the imagination,
may, without a paradox, be reckoned
among the solid comforts of life. Maria
now, imagining that she had found
a being of celestial mould&mdash;was happy,&mdash;nor
was she deceived.&mdash;He was then
plastic in her impassioned hand&mdash;and
reflected all the sentiments which animated
and warmed her.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XVI" id="CHAP_XVI"></a>CHAP. XVI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning confusion seemed to
reign in the house, and Jemima came
in terror, to inform Maria, "that her
master had left it, with a determination,
she was assured (and too many
circumstances corroborated the opinion,
to leave a doubt of its truth) of never
returning. I am prepared then,"
said Jemima, "to accompany you in
your flight."</p>

<p>Maria started up, her eyes darting
towards the door, as if afraid that some
one should fasten it on her for ever.</p>

<p>Jemima continued, "I have perhaps
no right now to expect the performance
of your promise; but on you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-130" id="Pg_2-130"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-130.png">130</a>]</span>
it depends to reconcile me with the
human race."</p>

<p>"But Darnford!"&mdash;exclaimed Maria,
mournfully&mdash;sitting down again,
and crossing her arms&mdash;"I have no
child to go to, and liberty has lost its
sweets."</p>

<p>"I am much mistaken, if Darnford
is not the cause of my master's flight&mdash;his
keepers assure me, that they have
promised to confine him two days
longer, and then he will be free&mdash;you
cannot see him; but they will give a
letter to him the moment he is free.&mdash;In
that inform him where he may find
you in London; fix on some hotel.
Give me your clothes; I will send them
out of the house with mine, and we
will slip out at the garden-gate. Write
your letter while I make these arrangements,
but lose no time!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-131" id="Pg_2-131"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-131.png">131</a>]</span>
In an agitation of spirit, not to be
calmed, Maria began to write to Darnford.
She called him by the sacred
name of "husband," and bade him "hasten
to her, to share her fortune, or she
would return to him."&mdash;An hotel in the
Adelphi was the place of rendezvous.</p>

<p>The letter was sealed and given in
charge; and with light footsteps, yet
terrified at the sound of them, she descended,
scarcely breathing, and with
an indistinct fear that she should never
get out at the garden gate. Jemima
went first.</p>

<p>A being, with a visage that would
have suited one possessed by a devil,
crossed the path, and seized Maria by
the arm. Maria had no fear but of being
detained&mdash;"Who are you? what
are you?" for the form was scarcely human.
"If you are made of flesh and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-132" id="Pg_2-132"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-132.png">132</a>]</span>
blood," his ghastly eyes glared on her,
"do not stop me!"</p>

<p>"Woman," interrupted a sepulchral
voice, "what have I to do with thee?"&mdash;Still
he grasped her hand, muttering
a curse.</p>

<p>"No, no; you have nothing to do
with me," she exclaimed, "this is a
moment of life and death!"&mdash;</p>

<p>With supernatural force she broke
from him, and, throwing her arms
round Jemima, cried, "Save me!" The
being, from whose grasp she had loosed
herself, took up a stone as they opened
the door, and with a kind of hellish
sport threw it after them. They were
out of his reach.</p>

<p>When Maria arrived in town, she
drove to the hotel already fixed on. But
she could not sit still&mdash;her child was ever
before her; and all that had passed dur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-133" id="Pg_2-133"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-133.png">133</a>]</span>ing
her confinement, appeared to be a
dream. She went to the house in the
suburbs, where, as she now discovered,
her babe had been sent. The moment
she entered, her heart grew sick; but
she wondered not that it had proved its
grave. She made the necessary enquiries,
and the church-yard was pointed
out, in which it rested under a turf. A
little frock which the nurse's child
wore (Maria had made it herself)
caught her eye. The nurse was glad
to sell it for half-a-guinea, and Maria
hastened away with the relic, and, re-entering
the hackney-coach which
waited for her, gazed on it, till she
reached her hotel.</p>

<p>She then waited on the attorney
who had made her uncle's will, and explained
to him her situation. He readily
advanced her some of the money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-134" id="Pg_2-134"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-134.png">134</a>]</span>
which still remained in his hands, and
promised to take the whole of the case
into consideration. Maria only wished
to be permitted to remain in quiet&mdash;She
found that several bills, apparently
with her signature, had been presented
to her agent, nor was she for a moment
at a loss to guess by whom they had
been forged; yet, equally averse to
threaten or intreat, she requested her
friend [the solicitor] to call on Mr. Venables.
He was not to be found at
home; but at length his agent, the attorney,
offered a conditional promise to
Maria, to leave her in peace, as long as
she behaved with propriety, if she
would give up the notes. Maria inconsiderately
consented&mdash;Darnford was
arrived, and she wished to be only alive
to love; she wished to forget the anguish
she felt whenever she thought of

They took a ready furnished lodging
together, for she was above disguise;
Jemima insisting on being considered
as her house-keeper, and to receive
the customary stipend. On no
other terms would she remain with her
friend.</p>

<p>Darnford was indefatigable in tracing
the mysterious circumstances of
his confinement. The cause was simply,
that a relation, a very distant one,
to whom he was heir, had died intestate,
leaving a considerable fortune.
On the news of Darnford's arrival [in
England, a person, intrusted with the
management of the property, and who
had the writings in his possession, determining,
by one bold stroke, to strip
Darnford of the succession,] had planned
his confinement; and [as soon
as he had taken the measures he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-136" id="Pg_2-136"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-136.png">136</a>]</span>
judged most conducive to his object,
this ruffian, together with his instrument,]
the keeper of the private mad-house,
left the kingdom. Darnford,
who still pursued his enquiries, at last
discovered that they had fixed their
place of refuge at Paris.</p>

<p>Maria and he determined therefore,
with the faithful Jemima, to visit
that metropolis, and accordingly were
preparing for the journey, when they
were informed that Mr. Venables had
commenced an action against Darnford
for seduction and adultery. The indignation
Maria felt cannot be explained;
she repented of the forbearance she had
exercised in giving up the notes. Darnford
could not put off his journey, without
risking the loss of his property:
Maria therefore furnished him with money
for his expedition; and determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-137" id="Pg_2-137"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-137.png">137</a>]</span>
to remain in London till the termination
of this affair.</p>

<p>She visited some ladies with whom
she had formerly been intimate, but
was refused admittance; and at the
opera, or Ranelagh, they could not recollect
her. Among these ladies there
were some, not her most intimate acquaintance,
who were generally supposed
to avail themselves of the cloke
of marriage, to conceal a mode of conduct,
that would for ever have damned
their fame, had they been innocent, seduced
girls. These particularly stood
aloof.&mdash;Had she remained with her husband,
practising insincerity, and neglecting
her child to manage an intrigue,
she would still have been visited
and respected. If, instead of
openly living with her lover, she could
have condescended to call into play a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-138" id="Pg_2-138"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-138.png">138</a>]</span>
thousand arts, which, degrading her
own mind, might have allowed the
people who were not deceived, to pretend
to be so, she would have been
caressed and treated like an honourable
woman. "And Brutus<a name="FNanchor_138-A_8" id="FNanchor_138-A_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_138-A_8" class="fnanchor">[138-A]</a> is an honourable
man!" said Mark-Antony with
equal sincerity.</p>

<p>With Darnford she did not taste uninterrupted
felicity; there was a volatility
in his manner which often distressed
her; but love gladdened the
scene; besides, he was the most tender,
sympathizing creature in the world.
A fondness for the sex often gives an
appearance of humanity to the behaviour
of men, who have small pretensions
to the reality; and they seem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-139" id="Pg_2-139"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-139.png">139</a>]</span>
love others, when they are only pursuing
their own gratification. Darnford
appeared ever willing to avail himself
of her taste and acquirements, while
she endeavoured to profit by his decision
of character, and to eradicate some
of the romantic notions, which had
taken root in her mind, while in adversity
she had brooded over visions of
unattainable bliss.</p>

<p>The real affections of life, when
they are allowed to burst forth, are buds
pregnant with joy and all the sweet
emotions of the soul; yet they branch
out with wild ease, unlike the artificial
forms of felicity, sketched by an imagination
painful alive. The substantial
happiness, which enlarges and civilizes
the mind, may be compared to
the pleasure experienced in roving
through nature at large, inhaling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-140" id="Pg_2-140"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-140.png">140</a>]</span>
sweet gale natural to the clime; while
the reveries of a feverish imagination
continually sport themselves in gardens
full of aromatic shrubs, which cloy
while they delight, and weaken the
sense of pleasure they gratify. The heaven
of fancy, below or beyond the stars,
in this life, or in those ever-smiling regions
surrounded by the unmarked
ocean of futurity, have an insipid uniformity
which palls. Poets have imagined
scenes of bliss; but, fencing out
sorrow, all the extatic emotions of the
soul, and even its grandeur, seem to
be equally excluded. We dose over
the unruffled lake, and long to scale
the rocks which fence the happy valley
of contentment, though serpents hiss
in the pathless desert, and danger lurks
in the unexplored wiles. Maria found
herself more indulgent as she was hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-141" id="Pg_2-141"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-141.png">141</a>]</span>pier,
and discovered virtues, in characters
she had before disregarded, while
chasing the phantoms of elegance and
excellence, which sported in the meteors
that exhale in the marshes of misfortune.
The heart is often shut by
romance against social pleasure; and,
fostering a sickly sensibility, grows callous
to the soft touches of humanity.</p>

<p>To part with Darnford was indeed
cruel.&mdash;It was to feel most painfully
alone; but she rejoiced to think, that
she should spare him the care and perplexity
of the suit, and meet him again,
all his own. Marriage, as at present
constituted, she considered as leading
to immorality&mdash;yet, as the odium of
society impedes usefulness, she wished to
avow her affection to Darnford, by becoming
his wife according to established
rules; not to be confounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-142" id="Pg_2-142"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-142.png">142</a>]</span>
with women who act from very different
motives, though her conduct would
be just the same without the ceremony
as with it, and her expectations from
him not less firm. The being summoned
to defend herself from a charge which
she was determined to plead guilty to,
was still galling, as it roused bitter reflections
on the situation of women in
society.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XVII" id="CHAP_XVII"></a>CHAP. XVII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> was her state of mind when
the dogs of law were let loose on
her. Maria took the task of conducting
Darnford's defence upon herself.
She instructed his counsel to plead
guilty to the charge of adultery; but
to deny that of seduction.</p>

<p>The counsel for the plaintiff opened
the cause, by observing, "that his client
had ever been an indulgent husband,
and had borne with several defects
of temper, while he had nothing
criminal to lay to the charge of his
wife. But that she left his house without
assigning any cause. He could not
assert that she was then acquainted
with the defendant; yet, when he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-144" id="Pg_2-144"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-144.png">144</a>]</span>
once endeavouring to bring her back
to her home, this man put the peace-officers
to flight, and took her he knew
not whither. After the birth of her child,
her conduct was so strange, and a melancholy
malady having afflicted one of
the family, which delicacy forbade the
dwelling on, it was necessary to confine
her. By some means the defendant
enabled her to make her escape,
and they had lived together, in despite
of all sense of order and decorum. The
adultery was allowed, it was not necessary
to bring any witnesses to prove it;
but the seduction, though highly probable
from the circumstances which
he had the honour to state, could not
be so clearly proved.&mdash;It was of the
most atrocious kind, as decency was set
at defiance, and respect for reputa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-145" id="Pg_2-145"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-145.png">145</a>]</span>tion,
which shows internal compunction,
utterly disregarded."</p>

<p>A strong sense of injustice had silenced
every emotion, which a mixture
of true and false delicacy might otherwise
have excited in Maria's bosom.
She only felt in earnest to insist on the
privilege of her nature. The sarcasms
of society, and the condemnation of a
mistaken world, were nothing to her,
compared with acting contrary to those
feelings which were the foundation of
her principles. [She therefore eagerly
put herself forward, instead of desiring
to be absent, on this memorable occasion.]</p>

<p>Convinced that the subterfuges of
the law were disgraceful, she wrote a
paper, which she expressly desired might
be read in court:</p>

<p>"Married when scarcely able to dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-146" id="Pg_2-146"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-146.png">146</a>]</span>tinguish
the nature of the engagement,
I yet submitted to the rigid
laws which enslave women, and obeyed
the man whom I could no longer love.
Whether the duties of the state are
reciprocal, I mean not to discuss; but
I can prove repeated infidelities which
I overlooked or pardoned. Witnesses
are not wanting to establish these facts.
I at present maintain the child of a
maid servant, sworn to him, and born
after our marriage. I am ready to allow,
that education and circumstances
lead men to think and act with less delicacy,
than the preservation of order
in society demands from women; but
surely I may without assumption declare,
that, though I could excuse the
birth, I could not the desertion of this
unfortunate babe:&mdash;and, while I despised
the man, it was not easy to ve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-147" id="Pg_2-147"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-147.png">147</a>]</span>nerate
the husband. With proper restrictions
however, I revere the institution
which fraternizes the world. I exclaim
against the laws which throw the
whole weight of the yoke on the weaker
shoulders, and force women, when they
claim protectorship as mothers, to sign
a contract, which renders them dependent
on the caprice of the tyrant, whom
choice or necessity has appointed to
reign over them. Various are the cases,
in which a woman ought to separate
herself from her husband; and mine,
I may be allowed emphatically to insist,
comes under the description of the
most aggravated.</p>

<p>"I will not enlarge on those provocations
which only the individual can
estimate; but will bring forward such
charges only, the truth of which is an
insult upon humanity. In order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-148" id="Pg_2-148"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-148.png">148</a>]</span>
promote certain destructive speculations,
Mr. Venables prevailed on me
to borrow certain sums of a wealthy relation;
and, when I refused further
compliance, he thought of bartering
my person; and not only allowed opportunities
to, but urged, a friend
from whom he borrowed money, to
seduce me. On the discovery of this
act of atrocity, I determined to leave
him, and in the most decided manner,
for ever. I consider all obligation as
made void by his conduct; and hold,
that schisms which proceed from want
of principles, can never be healed.</p>

<p>"He received a fortune with me to
the amount of five thousand pounds. On
the death of my uncle, convinced that
I could provide for my child, I destroyed
the settlement of that fortune.
I required none of my property to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-149" id="Pg_2-149"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-149.png">149</a>]</span>
returned to me, nor shall enumerate the
sums extorted from me during six years
that we lived together.</p>

<p>"After leaving, what the law considers
as my home, I was hunted like a criminal
from place to place, though I
contracted no debts, and demanded no
maintenance&mdash;yet, as the laws sanction
such proceeding, and make women the
property of their husbands, I forbear
to animadvert. After the birth of my
daughter, and the death of my uncle,
who left a very considerable property
to myself and child, I was exposed to
new persecution; and, because I had,
before arriving at what is termed years
of discretion, pledged my faith, I was
treated by the world, as bound for ever
to a man whose vices were notorious.
Yet what are the vices generally
known, to the various miseries that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-150" id="Pg_2-150"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-150.png">150</a>]</span>
woman may be subject to, which,
though deeply felt, eating into the
soul, elude description, and may be
glossed over! A false morality is even
established, which makes all the virtue
of women consist in chastity, submission,
and the forgiveness of injuries.</p>

<p>"I pardon my oppressor&mdash;bitterly as I
lament the loss of my child, torn from
me in the most violent manner. But
nature revolts, and my soul sickens at
the bare supposition, that it could ever
be a duty to pretend affection, when a
separation is necessary to prevent my
feeling hourly aversion.</p>

<p>"To force me to give my fortune, I
was imprisoned&mdash;yes; in a private mad-house.&mdash;There,
in the heart of misery,
I met the man charged with seducing
me. We became attached&mdash;I deemed,
and ever shall deem, myself free. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-151" id="Pg_2-151"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-151.png">151</a>]</span>
death of my babe dissolved the only tie
which subsisted between me and my,
what is termed, lawful husband.</p>

<p>"To this person, thus encountered,
I voluntarily gave myself, never considering
myself as any more bound to
transgress the laws of moral purity,
because the will of my husband
might be pleaded in my excuse, than
to transgress those laws to which
[the policy of artificial society has]
annexed [positive] punishments.&mdash;&mdash;While
no command of a husband can
prevent a woman from suffering for
certain crimes, she must be allowed
to consult her conscience, and regulate
her conduct, in some degree, by her
own sense of right. The respect I owe
to myself, demanded my strict adherence
to my determination of never
viewing Mr. Venables in the light of a
husband, nor could it forbid me from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-152" id="Pg_2-152"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-152.png">152</a>]</span>
encouraging another. If I am unfortunately
united to an unprincipled man,
am I for ever to be shut out from fulfilling
the duties of a wife and mother?&mdash;I
wish my country to approve of my
conduct; but, if laws exist, made by
the strong to oppress the weak, I appeal
to my own sense of justice, and
declare that I will not live with the
individual, who has violated every moral
obligation which binds man to man.</p>

<p>"I protest equally against any charge
being brought to criminate the man,
whom I consider as my husband. I
was six-and-twenty when I left Mr.
Venables' roof; if ever I am to be supposed
to arrive at an age to direct my
own actions, I must by that time have
arrived at it.&mdash;I acted with deliberation.&mdash;Mr.
Darnford found me a forlorn
and oppressed woman, and promised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-153" id="Pg_2-153"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-153.png">153</a>]</span>
the protection women in the present
state of society want.&mdash;But the man
who now claims me&mdash;was he deprived
of my society by this conduct? The
question is an insult to common sense,
considering where Mr. Darnford met
me.&mdash;Mr. Venables' door was indeed
open to me&mdash;nay, threats and intreaties
were used to induce me to return; but
why? Was affection or honour the
motive?&mdash;I cannot, it is true, dive into
the recesses of the human heart&mdash;yet
I presume to assert, [borne out as
I am by a variety of circumstances,]
that he was merely influenced by the
most rapacious avarice.</p>

<p>"I claim then a divorce, and the
liberty of enjoying, free from molestation,
the fortune left to me by a relation,
who was well aware of the character
of the man with whom I had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-154" id="Pg_2-154"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-154.png">154</a>]</span>
contend.&mdash;I appeal to the justice and
humanity of the jury&mdash;a body of men,
whose private judgment must be allowed
to modify laws, that must be
unjust, because definite rules can never
apply to indefinite circumstances&mdash;and
I deprecate punishment upon the man
of my choice, freeing him, as I solemnly
do, from the charge of seduction.]</p>

<p>"I did not put myself into a situation
to justify a charge of adultery, till
I had, from conviction, shaken off the
fetters which bound me to Mr. Venables.&mdash;While
I lived with him, I defy
the voice of calumny to sully what is
termed the fair fame of woman.&mdash;Neglected
by my husband, I never encouraged
a lover; and preserved with
scrupulous care, what is termed my
honour, at the expence of my peace,
till he, who should have been its guar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-155" id="Pg_2-155"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-155.png">155</a>]</span>dian,
laid traps to ensnare me. From
that moment I believed myself, in the
sight of heaven, free&mdash;and no power
on earth shall force me to renounce my
resolution."</p>

<p>The judge, in summing up the evidence,
alluded to "the fallacy of letting
women plead their feelings, as an excuse
for the violation of the marriage-vow.
For his part, he had always
determined to oppose all innovation,
and the new-fangled notions which incroached
on the good old rules of conduct.
We did not want French principles
in public or private life&mdash;and, if
women were allowed to plead their
feelings, as an excuse or palliation of
infidelity, it was opening a flood-gate
for immorality. What virtuous woman
thought of her feelings?&mdash;It was
her duty to love and obey the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-156" id="Pg_2-156"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-156.png">156</a>]</span>
chosen by her parents and relations,
who were qualified by their experience
to judge better for her, than she could
for herself. As to the charges brought
against the husband, they were vague,
supported by no witnesses, excepting
that of imprisonment in a private mad-house.
The proofs of an insanity in the
family, might render that however a
prudent measure; and indeed the conduct
of the lady did not appear that of
a person of sane mind. Still such a
mode of proceeding could not be justified,
and might perhaps entitle the
lady [in another court] to a sentence of
separation from bed and board, during
the joint lives of the parties; but he
hoped that no Englishman would legalize
adultery, by enabling the adulteress
to enrich her seducer. Too many restrictions
could not be thrown in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-157" id="Pg_2-157"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-157.png">157</a>]</span>
way of divorces, if we wished to maintain
the sanctity of marriage; and,
though they might bear a little hard on
a few, very few individuals, it was
evidently for the good of the whole."</p>

a nobler?&mdash;Surely it is better to die
with me, than to enter on life without

could I have deserted my child the

up: 'What have I not suffered!&mdash;may
I find a father where I am going!'&mdash;Her
head turned; a stupor ensued;
a faintness&mdash;'Have a little patience,'
said Maria, holding her swimming
head (she thought of her mother),
'this cannot last long; and what is a
little bodily pain to the pangs I have
endured?'</p>

<p>"A new vision swam before her.
Jemima seemed to enter&mdash;leading a little
creature, that, with tottering footsteps,
approached the bed. The voice
of Jemima sounding as at a distance,
called her&mdash;she tried to listen, to speak,
to look!</p>

<p>"'Behold your child!' exclaimed
Jemima. Maria started off the bed,
and fainted.&mdash;Violent vomiting followed.</p>

addressed her with great solemnity:
'&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; led me to suspect,
that your husband and brother had
deceived you, and secreted the child.
I would not torment you with doubtful
hopes, and I left you (at a fatal
moment) to search for the child!&mdash;I
snatched her from misery&mdash;and (now
she is alive again) would you leave
her alone in the world, to endure what
I have endured?'</p>

<p>"Maria gazed wildly at her, her
whole frame was convulsed with emotion;
when the child, whom Jemima
had been tutoring all the journey, uttered
the word 'Mamma!' She
caught her to her bosom, and burst
into a passion of tears&mdash;then, resting
the child gently on the bed, as if
afraid of killing it,&mdash;she put her hand
to her eyes, to conceal as it were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-165" id="Pg_2-165"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-165.png">165</a>]</span>
agonizing struggle of her soul. She
remained silent for five minutes, crossing
her arms over her bosom, and reclining
her head,&mdash;then exclaimed:
'The conflict is over!&mdash;I will live for
my child!'"</p>

<hr />

<p>A few readers perhaps, in looking
over these hints, will wonder how it
could have been practicable, without
tediousness, or remitting in any degree
the interest of the story, to have filled,
from these slight sketches, a number of
pages, more considerable than those
which have been already presented.
But, in reality, these hints, simple as
they are, are pregnant with passion and
distress. It is the refuge of barren au<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-166" id="Pg_2-166"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-166.png">166</a>]</span>thors
only, to crowd their fictions with
so great a number of events, as to suffer
no one of them to sink into the reader's
mind. It is the province of true genius
to develop events, to discover their
capabilities, to ascertain the different
passions and sentiments with which they
are fraught, and to diversify them with
incidents, that give reality to the picture,
and take a hold upon the mind of a
reader of taste, from which they can
never be loosened. It was particularly
the design of the author, in the present
instance, to make her story subordinate
to a great moral purpose, that "of exhibiting
the misery and oppression, peculiar
to women, that arise out of the
partial laws and customs of society.&mdash;This
view restrained her fancy<a name="FNanchor_166-A_10" id="FNanchor_166-A_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_166-A_10" class="fnanchor">[166-A]</a>." It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-167" id="Pg_2-167"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-167.png">167</a>]</span>
was necessary for her, to place in a striking
point of view, evils that are too
frequently overlooked, and to drag into
light those details of oppression, of
which the grosser and more insensible
part of mankind make little account.</p>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT,</h2>

<h3>BY THE EDITOR.</h3>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages will, I believe,
be judged by every reader of taste to
have been worth preserving, among
the other testimonies the author left
behind her, of her genius and the
soundness of her understanding. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-172" id="Pg_2-172"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-172.png">172</a>]</span>
such readers I leave the task of comparing
these lessons, with other works
of the same nature previously published.
It is obvious that the author has struck
out a path of her own, and by no means
intrenched upon the plans of her predecessors.</p>

<p>It may however excite surprise in
some persons to find these papers annexed
to the conclusion of a novel. All
I have to offer on this subject, consists
in the following considerations:</p>

<p>First, something is to be allowed for
the difficulty of arranging the miscellaneous
papers upon very different sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-173" id="Pg_2-173"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-173.png">173</a>]</span>jects,
which will frequently constitute
an author's posthumous works.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Secondly, the small portion they occupy
in the present volume, will perhaps
be accepted as an apology, by
such good-natured readers (if any such
there are), to whom the perusal of
them shall be a matter of perfect indifference.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Thirdly, the circumstance which
determined me in annexing them to
the present work, was the slight association
(in default of a strong one)
between the affectionate and pathetic
manner in which Maria Venables ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-174" id="Pg_2-174"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-174.png">174</a>]</span>dresses
her infant, in the Wrongs of
Woman; and the agonising and painful
sentiment with which the author
originally bequeathed these papers, as
a legacy for the benefit of her child.</p>

Shut the door. Bring the chair. Ring

Wash your hands. Dirty hands. Why
do you cry? A clean mouth. Shake
hands. I love you. Kiss me now.
Good girl.</p>

The cat jumps. The dog runs. The
bird flies. The cow lies down. The man

<p class="center">LESSON IV.</p>

<p>LET me comb your head. Ask Betty
to wash your face. Go and see for
some bread. Drink milk, if you are
dry. Play on the floor with the ball.
Do not touch the ink; you will black
your hands.</p>

<p>What do you want to say to me?
Speak slow, not so fast. Did you fall?
You will not cry, not you; the baby
cries. Will you walk in the fields?</p>


<p class="center">LESSON V.</p>

<p>COME to me, my little girl. Are
you tired of playing? Yes. Sit down
and rest yourself, while I talk to you.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-180" id="Pg_2-180"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-180.png">180</a>]</span>
Have you seen the baby? Poor little
thing. O here it comes. Look
at him. How helpless he is. Four
years ago you were as feeble as this
very little boy.</p>

<p>See, he cannot hold up his head.
He is forced to lie on his back, if his
mamma do not turn him to the right or
left side, he will soon begin to cry.
He cries to tell her, that he is tired
with lying on his back.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VI.</p>

<p>PERHAPS he is hungry. What
shall we give him to eat? Poor fellow,
he cannot eat. Look in his mouth, he
has no teeth.</p>

<p>How did you do when you were a baby
like him? You cannot tell. Do you
want to know? Look then at the dog,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-181" id="Pg_2-181"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-181.png">181</a>]</span>
with her pretty puppy. You could
not help yourself as well as the puppy.
You could only open your mouth,
when you were lying, like William, on
my knee. So I put you to my breast,
and you sucked, as the puppy sucks
now, for there was milk enough for
you.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VII.</p>

<p>WHEN you were hungry, you began
to cry, because you could not speak.
You were seven months without teeth,
always sucking. But after you got
one, you began to gnaw a crust of
bread. It was not long before another
came pop. At ten months you had
four pretty white teeth, and you used
to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did
not cry, because I am not a child, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-182" id="Pg_2-182"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-182.png">182</a>]</span>
you hurt me very much. So I said to
papa, it is time the little girl should
eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts
me. I have given her a crust of bread,
and I must look for some other milk.</p>

<p>The cow has got plenty, and her
jumping calf eats grass very well. He
has got more teeth than my little girl.
Yes, says papa, and he tapped you on
the cheek, you are old enough to learn
to eat? Come to me, and I will teach
you, my little dear, for you must not
hurt poor mamma, who has given you
her milk, when you could not take any
thing else.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VIII.</p>

<p>YOU were then on the carpet, for
you could not walk well. So when
you were in a hurry, you used to run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-183" id="Pg_2-183"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-183.png">183</a>]</span>
quick, quick, quick, on your hands
and feet, like the dog.</p>

<p>Away you ran to papa, and putting
both your arms round his leg, for your
hands were not big enough, you looked
up at him, and laughed. What did
this laugh say, when you could not
speak? Cannot you guess by what you
now say to papa?&mdash;Ah! it was, Play
with me, papa!&mdash;play with me!</p>

<p>Papa began to smile, and you knew
that the smile was always&mdash;Yes. So
you got a ball, and papa threw it along
the floor&mdash;Roll&mdash;roll&mdash;roll; and you
ran after it again&mdash;and again. How
pleased you were. Look at William,
he smiles; but you could laugh loud&mdash;Ha!
ha! ha!&mdash;Papa laughed louder
than the little girl, and rolled the ball
still faster.</p>

<p>Then he put the ball on a chair, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-184" id="Pg_2-184"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-184.png">184</a>]</span>
you were forced to take hold of the
back, and stand up to reach it. At
last you reached too far, and down you
fell: not indeed on your face, because
you put out your hands. You were not
much hurt; but the palms of your
hands smarted with the pain, and you
began to cry, like a little child.</p>

<p>It is only very little children who cry
when they are hurt; and it is to tell
their mamma, that something is the
matter with them. Now you can come
to me, and say, Mamma, I have hurt
myself. Pray rub my hand: it smarts.
Put something on it, to make it well.
A piece of rag, to stop the blood.
You are not afraid of a little blood&mdash;not
you. You scratched your arm with
a pin: it bled a little; but it did you
no harm. See, the skin is grown over
it again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-185" id="Pg_2-185"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-185.png">185</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">LESSON IX.</p>

<p>TAKE care not to put pins in your
mouth, because they will stick in your
throat, and give you pain. Oh! you
cannot think what pain a pin would
give you in your throat, should it remain
there: but, if you by chance
swallow it, I should be obliged to give
you, every morning, something bitter
to drink. You never tasted any thing
so bitter! and you would grow very
sick. I never put pins in my mouth;
but I am older than you, and know how
to take care of myself.</p>

<p>My mamma took care of me, when I
was a little girl, like you. She bade
me never put any thing in my mouth,
without asking her what it was.</p>

<p>When you were a baby, with no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-186" id="Pg_2-186"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-186.png">186</a>]</span>
sense than William, you put every thing
in your mouth to gnaw, to help your
teeth to cut through the skin. Look
at the puppy, how he bites that piece
of wood. William presses his gums
against my finger. Poor boy! he is so
young, he does not know what he is
doing. When you bite any thing, it is
because you are hungry.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON X.</p>

<p>SEE how much taller you are than
William. In four years you have learned
to eat, to walk, to talk. Why do you
smile? You can do much more, you
think: you can wash your hands and
face. Very well. I should never kiss
a dirty face. And you can comb your
head with the pretty comb you always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-187" id="Pg_2-187"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-187.png">187</a>]</span>
put by in your own drawer. To be
sure, you do all this to be ready to take
a walk with me. You would be obliged
to stay at home, if you could not comb
your own hair. Betty is busy getting
the dinner ready, and only brushes
William's hair, because he cannot do it
for himself.</p>

<p>Betty is making an apple-pye. You
love an apple-pye; but I do not bid
you make one. Your hands are not
strong enough to mix the butter and
flour together; and you must not try to
pare the apples, because you cannot
manage a great knife.</p>

<p>Never touch the large knives: they
are very sharp, and you might cut your
finger to the bone. You are a little
girl, and ought to have a little knife.
When you are as tall as I am, you shall
have a knife as large as mine; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-188" id="Pg_2-188"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-188.png">188</a>]</span>
when you are as strong as I am, and
have learned to manage it, you will not
hurt yourself.</p>

<p>You can trundle a hoop, you say;
and jump over a stick. O, I forgot!&mdash;and
march like the men in the red
coats, when papa plays a pretty tune on
the fiddle.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XI.</p>

<p>WHAT, you think that you shall
soon be able to dress yourself entirely?
I am glad of it: I have something else
to do. You may go, and look for your
frock in the drawer; but I will tie it,
till you are stronger. Betty will tie it,
when I am busy.</p>

<p>I button my gown myself: I do not
want a maid to assist me, when I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-189" id="Pg_2-189"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-189.png">189</a>]</span>
dressing. But you have not yet got
sense enough to do it properly, and
must beg somebody to help you, till you
are older.</p>

<p>Children grow older and wiser at the
same time. William is not able to take
a piece of meat, because he has not got
the sense which would make him think
that, without teeth, meat would do him
harm. He cannot tell what is good for
him.</p>

<p>The sense of children grows with
them. You know much more than
William, now you walk alone, and talk;
but you do not know as much as the
boys and girls you see playing yonder,
who are half as tall again as you; and
they do not know half as much as their
fathers and mothers, who are men and
women grown. Papa and I were children,
like you; and men and women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-190" id="Pg_2-190"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-190.png">190</a>]</span>
took care of us. I carry William, because
he is too weak to walk. I lift
you over a stile, and over the gutter,
when you cannot jump over it.</p>

<p>You know already, that potatoes
will not do you any harm: but I must
pluck the fruit for you, till you are wise
enough to know the ripe apples and
pears. The hard ones would make you
sick, and then you must take physic.
You do not love physic: I do not love
it any more than you. But I have more
sense than you; therefore I take care
not to eat unripe fruit, or any thing else
that would make my stomach ache, or
bring out ugly red spots on my face.</p>

<p>When I was a child, my mamma
chose the fruit for me, to prevent my
making myself sick. I was just like
you; I used to ask for what I saw, without
knowing whether it was good or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-191" id="Pg_2-191"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-191.png">191</a>]</span>
bad. Now I have lived a long time, I
know what is good; I do not want any
body to tell me.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XII.</p>

<p>LOOK at those two dogs. The old
one brings the ball to me in a moment;
the young one does not know how.
He must be taught.</p>

<p>I can cut your shift in a proper shape.
You would not know how to begin.
You would spoil it; but you will learn.</p>

<p>John digs in the garden, and knows
when to put the seed in the ground.
You cannot tell whether it should be in
the winter or summer. Try to find it
out. When do the trees put out their
leaves? In the spring, you say, after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-192" id="Pg_2-192"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-192.png">192</a>]</span>
cold weather. Fruit would not grow
ripe without very warm weather. Now
I am sure you can guess why the summer
is the season for fruit.</p>

<p>Papa knows that peas and beans are
good for us to eat with our meat. You
are glad when you see them; but if he
did not think for you, and have the
seed put in the ground, we should have
no peas or beans.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XIII.</p>

<p>POOR child, she cannot do much for
herself. When I let her do any thing
for me, it is to please her: for I could
do it better myself.</p>

<p>Oh! the poor puppy has tumbled
off the stool. Run and stroak him. Put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-193" id="Pg_2-193"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-193.png">193</a>]</span>
a little milk in a saucer to comfort him.
You have more sense than he. You
can pour the milk into the saucer without
spilling it. He would cry for a day
with hunger, without being able to get
it. You are wiser than the dog, you
must help him. The dog will love you
for it, and run after you. I feed you
and take care of you: you love me
and follow me for it.</p>

<p>When the book fell down on your
foot, it gave you great pain. The poor
dog felt the same pain just now.</p>

<p>Take care not to hurt him when you
play with him. And every morning
leave a little milk in your bason for
him. Do not forget to put the bason
in a corner, lest somebody should fall
over it.</p>

<p>When the snow covers the ground,
save the crumbs of bread for the birds.
In the summer they find feed enough,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-194" id="Pg_2-194"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-194.png">194</a>]</span>
and do not want you to think about
them.</p>

<p>I make broth for the poor man who
is sick. A sick man is like a child, he
cannot help himself.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON X.</p>

<p>WHEN I caught cold some time
ago, I had such a pain in my head, I
could scarcely hold it up. Papa
opened the door very softly, because
he loves me. You love me, yet you
made a noise. You had not the sense
to know that it made my head worse,
till papa told you.</p>

<p>Papa had a pain in the stomach, and
he would not eat the fine cherries or
grapes on the table. When I brought
him a cup of camomile tea, he drank
it without saying a word, or making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-195" id="Pg_2-195"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-195.png">195</a>]</span>
an ugly face. He knows that I love
him, and that I would not give him
any thing to drink that has a bad taste,
if it were not to do him good.</p>

<p>You asked me for some apples when
your stomach ached; but I was not angry
with you. If you had been as wise
as papa, you would have said, I will
not eat the apples to-day, I must take
some camomile tea.</p>

<p>You say that you do not know how
to think. Yes; you do a little. The
other day papa was tired; he had been
walking about all the morning. After
dinner he fell asleep on the sopha. I
did not bid you be quiet; but you
thought of what papa said to you,
when my head ached. This made you
think that you ought not to make a
noise, when papa was resting himself.
So you came to me, and said to me,
very softly, Pray reach me my ball, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-196" id="Pg_2-196"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-196.png">196</a>]</span>
I will go and play in the garden, till
papa wakes.</p>

<p>You were going out; but thinking
again, you came back to me on your
tip-toes. Whisper&mdash;&mdash;whisper. Pray
mama, call me, when papa wakes;
for I shall be afraid to open the door
to see, lest I should disturb him.</p>

<p>Away you went.&mdash;Creep&mdash;creep&mdash;and
shut the door as softly as I could
have done myself.</p>

<p>That was thinking. When a child
does wrong at first, she does not know
any better. But, after she has been told
that she must not disturb mama, when
poor mama is unwell, she thinks herself,
that she must not wake papa when
he is tired.</p>

<p>Another day we will see if you can
think about any thing else.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I Re&#383;ume</span> my pen to fly from thought.
I was married; and we ha&#383;tened to
London. I had purpo&#383;ed taking one of
my &#383;i&#383;ters with me; for a &#383;trong motive
for marrying, was the de&#383;ire of having
a home at which I could receive them,
now their own grew &#383;o uncomfortable,
as not to de&#383;erve the cheering appellation.
An objection was made to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-2_S" id="Pg_2-2_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-2.png">2</a>]</span>
accompanying me, that appeared plau&#383;ible;
and I reluctantly acquie&#383;ced. I
was however willingly allowed to take
with me Molly, poor Peggy's daughter.
London and preferment, are ideas commonly
a&#383;&#383;ociated in the country; and,
as blooming as May, &#383;he bade adieu to
Peggy with weeping eyes. I did not
even feel hurt at the refu&#383;al in relation
to my &#383;i&#383;ter, till hearing what my uncle
had done for me, I had the &#383;implicity
to reque&#383;t, &#383;peaking with warmth of
their &#383;ituation, that he would give them
a thou&#383;and pounds a-piece, which
&#383;eemed to me but ju&#383;tice. He a&#383;ked
me, giving me a ki&#383;s, 'If I had lo&#383;t my
&#383;en&#383;es?' I &#383;tarted back, as if I had
found a wa&#383;p in a ro&#383;e-bu&#383;h. I expo&#383;tulated.
He &#383;neered; and the demon
of di&#383;cord entered our paradi&#383;e, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-3_S" id="Pg_2-3_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-3.png">3</a>]</span>
poi&#383;on with his pe&#383;tiferous breath every
opening joy.</p>

<p>"I had &#383;ometimes ob&#383;erved defects
in my hu&#383;band's under&#383;tanding; but, led
a&#383;tray by a prevailing opinion, that
goodne&#383;s of di&#383;po&#383;ition is of the fir&#383;t importance
in the relative &#383;ituations of
life, in proportion as I perceived the
narrowne&#383;s of his under&#383;tanding, fancy
enlarged the boundary of his heart.
Fatal error! How quickly is the &#383;o
much vaunted milkine&#383;s of nature turned
into gall, by an intercour&#383;e with the
world, if more generous juices do not
&#383;u&#383;tain the vital &#383;ource of virtue!</p>

<p>"One trait in my character was extreme
credulity; but, when my eyes were
once opened, I &#383;aw but too clearly all
I had before overlooked. My hu&#383;band
was &#383;unk in my e&#383;teem; &#383;till there are
youthful emotions, which, for a while,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-4_S" id="Pg_2-4_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-4.png">4</a>]</span>
fill up the cha&#383;m of love and friend&#383;hip.
Be&#383;ides, it required &#383;ome time to enable
me to &#383;ee his whole character in a
ju&#383;t light, or rather to allow it to become
fixed. While circum&#383;tances were
ripening my faculties, and cultivating
my ta&#383;te, commerce and gro&#383;s relaxations
were &#383;hutting his again&#383;t any
po&#383;&#383;ibility of improvement, till, by
&#383;tifling every &#383;park of virtue in him&#383;elf,
he began to imagine that it no where
exi&#383;ted.</p>

<p>"Do not let me lead you a&#383;tray, my
child, I do not mean to a&#383;&#383;ert, that
any human being is entirely incapable
of feeling the generous emotions, which
are the foundation of every true principle
of virtue; but they are frequently,
I fear, &#383;o feeble, that, like the inflammable
quality which more or le&#383;s
lurks in all bodies, they often lie for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-5_S" id="Pg_2-5_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-5.png">5</a>]</span>
ever dormant; the circum&#383;tances never
occurring, nece&#383;&#383;ary to call them into
action.</p>

<p>"I di&#383;covered however by chance,
that, in con&#383;equence of &#383;ome lo&#383;&#383;es in
trade, the natural effect of his gambling
de&#383;ire to &#383;tart &#383;uddenly into riches,
the five thou&#383;and pounds given me by
my uncle, had been paid very opportunely.
This di&#383;covery, &#383;trange as you
may think the a&#383;&#383;ertion, gave me plea&#383;ure;
my hu&#383;band's embarra&#383;&#383;ments
endeared him to me. I was glad to
find an excu&#383;e for his conduct to my
&#383;i&#383;ters, and my mind became calmer.</p>

<p>"My uncle introduced me to &#383;ome
literary &#383;ociety; and the theatres were
a never-failing &#383;ource of amu&#383;ement to
me. My delighted eye followed Mrs.
Siddons, when, with dignified delicacy,
&#383;he played Cali&#383;ta; and I involuntarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-6_S" id="Pg_2-6_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-6.png">6</a>]</span>
repeated after her, in the &#383;ame tone,
and with a long-drawn &#383;igh,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hearts like our's were pair'd&mdash;not match'd.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The&#383;e were, at fir&#383;t, &#383;pontaneous
emotions, though, becoming acquainted
with men of wit and poli&#383;hed manners,
I could not &#383;ometimes help regretting
my early marriage; and that,
in my ha&#383;te to e&#383;cape from a temporary
dependence, and expand my newly
fledged wings, in an unknown &#383;ky, I
had been caught in a trap, and caged
for life. Still the novelty of London,
and the attentive fondne&#383;s of my hu&#383;band,
for he had &#383;ome per&#383;onal regard
for me, made &#383;everal months glide
away. Yet, not forgetting the &#383;ituation
of my &#383;i&#383;ters, who were &#383;till very
young, I prevailed on my uncle to &#383;et<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-7_S" id="Pg_2-7_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-7.png">7</a>]</span>tle
a thou&#383;and pounds on each; and
to place them in a &#383;chool near town,
where I could frequently vi&#383;it, as well
as have them at home with me.</p>

<p>"I now tried to improve my hu&#383;band's
ta&#383;te, but we had few &#383;ubjects in
common; indeed he &#383;oon appeared
to have little reli&#383;h for my &#383;ociety, unle&#383;s
he was hinting to me the u&#383;e he
could make of my uncle's wealth.
When we had company, I was di&#383;gu&#383;ted
by an o&#383;tentatious di&#383;play of
riches, and I have often quitted the
room, to avoid li&#383;tening to exaggerated
tales of money obtained by lucky hits.</p>

<p>"With all my attention and affectionate
intere&#383;t, I perceived that I
could not become the friend or confident
of my hu&#383;band. Every thing I
learned relative to his affairs I gathered
up by accident; and I vainly endea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-8_S" id="Pg_2-8_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-8.png">8</a>]</span>voured
to e&#383;tabli&#383;h, at our fire-&#383;ide,
that &#383;ocial conver&#383;e, which often renders
people of different characters dear to
each other. Returning from the theatre,
or any amu&#383;ing party, I frequently
began to relate what I had &#383;een and
highly reli&#383;hed; but with &#383;ullen taciturnity
he &#383;oon &#383;ilenced me. I &#383;eemed
therefore gradually to lo&#383;e, in his &#383;ociety,
the &#383;oul, the energies of which
had ju&#383;t been in action. To &#383;uch a degree,
in fact, did his cold, re&#383;erved
manner affect me, that, after &#383;pending
&#383;ome days with him alone, I have
imagined my&#383;elf the mo&#383;t &#383;tupid creature
in the world, till the abilities of
&#383;ome ca&#383;ual vi&#383;itor convinced me that I
had &#383;ome dormant animation, and &#383;entiments
above the du&#383;t in which I had
been groveling. The very countenance
of my hu&#383;band changed; his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-9_S" id="Pg_2-9_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-9.png">9</a>]</span>plexion
became &#383;allow, and all the
charms of youth were vani&#383;hing with
its vivacity.</p>

<p>"I give you one view of the &#383;ubject;
but the&#383;e experiments and alterations
took up the &#383;pace of five years; during
which period, I had mo&#383;t reluctantly extorted
&#383;everal &#383;ums from my uncle, to
&#383;ave my hu&#383;band, to u&#383;e his own words,
from de&#383;truction. At fir&#383;t it was to prevent
bills being noted, to the injury of
his credit; then to bail him; and afterwards
to prevent an execution from
entering the hou&#383;e. I began at la&#383;t to
conclude, that he would have made
more exertions of his own to extricate
him&#383;elf, had he not relied on mine,
cruel as was the ta&#383;k he impo&#383;ed on me;
and I firmly determined that I would
make u&#383;e of no more pretexts.</p>

<p>"From the moment I pronounced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-10_S" id="Pg_2-10_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-10.png">10</a>]</span>
this determination, indifference on his
part was changed into rudene&#383;s, or
&#383;omething wor&#383;e.</p>

<p>"He now &#383;eldom dined at home,
and continually returned at a late hour,
drunk, to bed. I retired to another
apartment; I was glad, I own, to
e&#383;cape from his; for per&#383;onal intimacy
without affection, &#383;eemed, to me the
mo&#383;t degrading, as well as the mo&#383;t
painful &#383;tate in which a woman of any
ta&#383;te, not to &#383;peak of the peculiar delicacy
of fo&#383;tered &#383;en&#383;ibility, could be
placed. But my hu&#383;band's fondne&#383;s
for women was of the gro&#383;&#383;e&#383;t kind,
and imagination was &#383;o wholly out of
the que&#383;tion, as to render his indulgences
of this &#383;ort entirely promi&#383;cuous,
and of the mo&#383;t brutal nature.
My health &#383;uffered, before my heart
was entirely e&#383;tranged by the loath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-11_S" id="Pg_2-11_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-11.png">11</a>]</span>&#383;ome
information; could I then have
returned to his &#383;ullied arms, but as a
victim to the prejudices of mankind,
who have made women the property of
their hu&#383;bands? I di&#383;covered even,
by his conver&#383;ation, when intoxicated,
that his favourites were wantons of the
lowe&#383;t cla&#383;s, who could by their vulgar,
indecent mirth, which he called nature,
rou&#383;e his &#383;luggi&#383;h &#383;pirits. Meretricious
ornaments and manners were
nece&#383;&#383;ary to attract his attention. He
&#383;eldom looked twice at a mode&#383;t woman,
and &#383;at &#383;ilent in their company;
and the charms of youth and beauty
had not the &#383;lighte&#383;t effect on his &#383;en&#383;es,
unle&#383;s the po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ors were initiated in
vice. His intimacy with profligate women,
and his habits of thinking, gave
him a contempt for female endowments;
and he would repeat, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-12_S" id="Pg_2-12_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-12.png">12</a>]</span>
wine had loo&#383;ed his tongue, mo&#383;t of the
common-place &#383;arca&#383;ms levelled at
them, by men who do not allow them
to have minds, becau&#383;e mind would be
an impediment to gro&#383;s enjoyment.
Men who are inferior to their fellow
men, are always mo&#383;t anxious to e&#383;tabli&#383;h
their &#383;uperiority over women.
But where are the&#383;e reflections leading
me?</p>

<p>"Women who have lo&#383;t their hu&#383;band's
affection, are ju&#383;tly reproved for
neglecting their per&#383;ons, and not taking
the &#383;ame pains to keep, as to gain a
heart; but who thinks of giving the
&#383;ame advice to men, though women
are continually &#383;tigmatized for being
attached to fops; and from the nature
of their education, are more &#383;u&#383;ceptible
of di&#383;gu&#383;t? Yet why a woman &#383;hould
be expected to endure a &#383;loven, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-13_S" id="Pg_2-13_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-13.png">13</a>]</span>
more patience than a man, and magnanimou&#383;ly
to govern her&#383;elf, I cannot
conceive; unle&#383;s it be &#383;uppo&#383;ed arrogant
in her to look for re&#383;pect as well as a
maintenance. It is not ea&#383;y to be
plea&#383;ed, becau&#383;e, after promi&#383;ing to
love, in different circum&#383;tances, we are
told that it is our duty. I cannot, I
am &#383;ure (though, when attending the
&#383;ick, I never felt di&#383;gu&#383;t) forget my
own &#383;en&#383;ations, when ri&#383;ing with health
and &#383;pirit, and after &#383;centing the &#383;weet
morning, I have met my hu&#383;band at
the breakfa&#383;t table. The active attention
I had been giving to dome&#383;tic regulations,
which were generally &#383;ettled
before he ro&#383;e, or a walk, gave a glow
to my countenance, that contra&#383;ted with
his &#383;quallid appearance. The &#383;queami&#383;hne&#383;s
of &#383;tomach alone, produced
by the la&#383;t night's intemperance, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-14_S" id="Pg_2-14_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-14.png">14</a>]</span>
he took no pains to conceal, de&#383;troyed
my appetite. I think I now &#383;ee him
lolling in an arm-chair, in a dirty powdering
gown, &#383;oiled linen, ungartered
&#383;tockings, and tangled hair, yawning
and &#383;tretching him&#383;elf. The new&#383;paper
was immediately called for, if not
brought in on the tea-board, from
which he would &#383;carcely lift his eyes
while I poured out the tea, excepting
to a&#383;k for &#383;ome brandy to put into it, or
to declare that he could not eat. In
an&#383;wer to any que&#383;tion, in his be&#383;t humour,
it was a drawling 'What do
you &#383;ay, child?' But if I demanded
money for the hou&#383;e expences, which I
put off till the la&#383;t moment, his cu&#383;tomary
reply, often prefaced with an
oath, was, 'Do you think me, madam,
made of money?'&mdash;The butcher,
the baker, mu&#383;t wait; and, what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-15_S" id="Pg_2-15_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-15.png">15</a>]</span>
wor&#383;e, I was often obliged to witne&#383;s
his &#383;urly di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ion of trade&#383;men, who
were in want of their money, and
whom I &#383;ometimes paid with the pre&#383;ents
my uncle gave me for my own
u&#383;e.</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">"</ins>At this juncture my father's mi&#383;tre&#383;s,
by terrifying his con&#383;cience, prevailed
on him to marry her; he was already
become a methodi&#383;t; and my brother,
who now practi&#383;ed for him&#383;elf, had di&#383;covered
a flaw in the &#383;ettlement made
on my mother's children, which &#383;et it
a&#383;ide, and he allowed my father, who&#383;e

were accompli&#383;hed, yet you can (may

I had to place them in the &#383;ituation
of governe&#383;&#383;es, the only one in which
even a well-educated woman, with
more than ordinary talents, can &#383;truggle
for a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence; and even this is a
dependence next to menial. Is it then
&#383;urpri&#383;ing, that &#383;o many forlorn women,
with human pa&#383;&#383;ions and feelings, take
refuge in infamy? Alone in large man&#383;ions,

companions with whom they could conver&#383;e
on equal terms, or from whom
they could expect the endearments of

the &#383;ound of joy made them &#383;ad; and
the younge&#383;t, having a more delicate

great difficulty that I, who now almo&#383;t
&#383;upported the hou&#383;e by loans from my
uncle, could prevail on the <i>ma&#383;ter</i> of it,
to allow her a room to die in. I watched
her &#383;ick bed for &#383;ome months, and then
clo&#383;ed her eyes, gentle &#383;pirit! for ever.
She was pretty, with very engaging
manners; yet had never an opportunity
to marry, excepting to a very old man.
She had abilities &#383;ufficient to have
&#383;hone in any profe&#383;&#383;ion, had there been
any profe&#383;&#383;ions for women, though &#383;he
&#383;hrunk at the name of milliner or mantua-maker
as degrading to a gentlewoman.
I would not term this feeling
fal&#383;e pride to any one but you, my
child, whom I fondly hope to &#383;ee (yes;
I will indulge the hope for a moment!)
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of that energy of character
which gives dignity to any &#383;tation; and
with that clear, firm &#383;pirit that will en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-18_S" id="Pg_2-18_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-18.png">18</a>]</span>able
you to choo&#383;e a &#383;ituation for your&#383;elf,
or &#383;ubmit to be cla&#383;&#383;ed in the lowe&#383;t,
if it be the only one in which you
can be the mi&#383;tre&#383;s of your own actions.</p>

<p>"Soon after the death of my &#383;i&#383;ter,
an incident occurred, to prove to me that
the heart of a libertine is dead to natural
affection; and to convince me,
that the being who has appeared all
tenderne&#383;s, to gratify a &#383;elfi&#383;h pa&#383;&#383;ion,
is as regardle&#383;s of the innocent fruit of
it, as of the object, when the fit is over.
I had ca&#383;ually ob&#383;erved an old, mean-looking
woman, who called on my hu&#383;band
every two or three months to receive
&#383;ome money. One day entering
the pa&#383;&#383;age of his little counting-hou&#383;e,
as &#383;he was going out, I
heard her &#383;ay, 'The child is very weak;
&#383;he cannot live long, &#383;he will &#383;oon die<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-19_S" id="Pg_2-19_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-19.png">19</a>]</span>
out of your way, &#383;o you need not grudge
her a little phy&#383;ic.'</p>

<p>"'So much the better,' he replied,
'and pray mind your own bu&#383;ine&#383;s,
good woman.'</p>

<p>"I was &#383;truck by his unfeeling, inhuman
tone of voice, and drew back,
determined when the woman came
again, to try to &#383;peak to her, not out
of curio&#383;ity, I had heard enough, but
with the hope of being u&#383;eful to a poor,
outca&#383;t girl.</p>

<p>"A month or two elap&#383;ed before I
&#383;aw this woman again; and then &#383;he
had a child in her hand that tottered
along, &#383;carcely able to &#383;u&#383;tain her own
weight. They were going away, to
return at the hour Mr. Venables was
expected; he was now from home. I
de&#383;ired the woman to walk into the
parlour. She he&#383;itated, yet obeyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-20_S" id="Pg_2-20_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-20.png">20</a>]</span>
I a&#383;&#383;ured her that I &#383;hould not mention
to my hu&#383;band (the word &#383;eemed to
weigh on my re&#383;piration), that I had &#383;een
her, or his child. The woman &#383;tared
at me with a&#383;toni&#383;hment; and I turned
my eyes on the &#383;qualid object [that accompanied
her.] She could hardly &#383;upport
her&#383;elf, her complexion was &#383;allow,
and her eyes inflamed, with an inde&#383;cribable
look of cunning, mixed with
the wrinkles produced by the peevi&#383;hne&#383;s
of pain.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins>Poor child!' I exclaimed. 'Ah!
you may well &#383;ay poor child,' replied
the woman. 'I brought her here to &#383;ee
whether he would have the heart to
look at her, and not get &#383;ome advice.
I do not know what they de&#383;erve who
nur&#383;ed her. Why, her legs bent under
her like a bow when &#383;he came to me,
and &#383;he has never been well &#383;ince; but,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-21_S" id="Pg_2-21_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-21.png">21</a>]</span>
if they were no better paid than I am,
it is not to be wondered at, &#383;ure
enough.'</p>

<p>"On further enquiry I was informed,
that this mi&#383;erable &#383;pectacle was the
daughter of a &#383;ervant, a country girl,
who caught Mr. Venables' eye, and
whom he &#383;educed. On his marriage he
&#383;ent her away, her &#383;ituation being too
vi&#383;ible. After her delivery, &#383;he was
thrown on the town; and died in an
ho&#383;pital within the year. The babe
was &#383;ent to a pari&#383;h-nur&#383;e, and afterwards
to this woman, who did not
&#383;eem much better; but what was to be
expected from &#383;uch a clo&#383;e bargain?
She was only paid three &#383;hillings a week
for board and wa&#383;hing.</p>

<p>"The woman begged me to give her
&#383;ome old clothes for the child, a&#383;&#383;uring
me, that &#383;he was almo&#383;t afraid to a&#383;k<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-22_S" id="Pg_2-22_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-22.png">22</a>]</span>
ma&#383;ter for money to buy even a pair
of &#383;hoes.</p>

<p>"I grew &#383;ick at heart. And, fearing
Mr. Venables might enter, and oblige
me to expre&#383;s my abhorrence, I ha&#383;tily
enquired where &#383;he lived, promi&#383;ed to
pay her two &#383;hillings a week more, and
to call on her in a day or two; putting
a trifle into her hand as a proof of my
good intention.</p>

<p>"If the &#383;tate of this child affected me,
what were my feelings at a di&#383;covery I

<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> father's &#383;ituation was now &#383;o
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ing, that I prevailed on my uncle
to accompany me to vi&#383;it him; and
to lend me his a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance, to prevent the
whole property of the family from becoming
the prey of my brother's rapacity;
for, to extricate him&#383;elf out of
pre&#383;ent difficulties, my father was totally
regardle&#383;s of futurity. I took
down with me &#383;ome pre&#383;ents for my
&#383;tep-mother; it did not require an effort
for me to treat her with civility, or
to forget the pa&#383;t.</p>

<p>"This was the fir&#383;t time I had vi&#383;ited
my native village, &#383;ince my marriage.
But with what different emotions did
I return from the bu&#383;y world, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-24_S" id="Pg_2-24_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-24.png">24</a>]</span>
heavy weight of experience benumbing
my imagination, to &#383;cenes, that whi&#383;pered
recollections of joy and hope
mo&#383;t eloquently to my heart! The
fir&#383;t &#383;cent of the wild flowers from the
heath, thrilled through my veins, awakening
every &#383;en&#383;e to plea&#383;ure. The icy
hand of de&#383;pair &#383;eemed to be removed
from my bo&#383;om; and&mdash;forgetting my
hu&#383;band&mdash;the nurtured vi&#383;ions of a romantic
mind, bur&#383;ting on me with all
their original wildne&#383;s and gay exuberance,
were again hailed as &#383;weet realities.
I forgot, with equal facility,
that I ever felt &#383;orrow, or knew care
in the country; while a tran&#383;ient rainbow
&#383;tole athwart the cloudy &#383;ky of de&#383;pondency.
The picture&#383;que form of
&#383;everal favourite trees, and the porches
of rude cottages, with their &#383;miling
hedges, were recognized with the glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-25_S" id="Pg_2-25_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-25.png">25</a>]</span>&#383;ome
playfulne&#383;s of childi&#383;h vivacity.
I could have ki&#383;&#383;ed the chickens that
pecked on the common; and longed to
pat the cows, and frolic with the dogs
that &#383;ported on it. I gazed with delight
on the windmill, and thought it
lucky that it &#383;hould be in motion, at
the moment I pa&#383;&#383;ed by; and entering
the dear green lane, which led directly
to the village, the &#383;ound of the well-known
rookery gave that &#383;entimental
tinge to the varying &#383;en&#383;ations of my
active &#383;oul, which only &#383;erved to
heighten the lu&#383;tre of the luxuriant
&#383;cenery. But, &#383;pying, as I advanced,
the &#383;pire, peeping over the withered tops
of the aged elms that compo&#383;ed the
rookery, my thoughts flew immediately
to the church-yard, and tears of affection,
&#383;uch was the effect of my imagination,
bedewed my mother's grave!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-26_S" id="Pg_2-26_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-26.png">26</a>]</span>
Sorrow gave place to devotional feelings.
I wandered through the church
in fancy, as I u&#383;ed &#383;ometimes to do on
a Saturday evening. I recollected with
what fervour I addre&#383;&#383;ed the God of
my youth: and once more with rapturous
love looked above my &#383;orrows
to the Father of nature. I pau&#383;e&mdash;feeling
forcibly all the emotions I am de&#383;cribing;
and (reminded, as I regi&#383;ter
my &#383;orrows, of the &#383;ublime calm I have
felt, when in &#383;ome tremendous &#383;olitude,
my &#383;oul re&#383;ted on it&#383;elf, and
&#383;eemed to fill the univer&#383;e) I in&#383;en&#383;ibly
breathe &#383;oft, hu&#383;hing every wayward
emotion, as if fearing to &#383;ully with a
&#383;igh, a contentment &#383;o extatic.</p>

<p>"Having &#383;ettled my father's affairs,
and, by my exertions in his favour, made
my brother my &#383;worn foe, I returned
to London. My hu&#383;band's conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-27_S" id="Pg_2-27_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-27.png">27</a>]</span>
was now changed; I had during my
ab&#383;ence, received &#383;everal affectionate,
penitential letters from him; and he
&#383;eemed on my arrival, to wi&#383;h by his
behaviour to prove his &#383;incerity. I
could not then conceive why he acted
thus; and, when the &#383;u&#383;picion darted
into my head, that it might ari&#383;e from
ob&#383;erving my increa&#383;ing influence with
my uncle, I almo&#383;t de&#383;pi&#383;ed my&#383;elf for
imagining that &#383;uch a degree of deba&#383;ing
&#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s could exi&#383;t.</p>

<p>"He became, unaccountable as was
the change, tender and attentive; and,
attacking my weak &#383;ide, made a confe&#383;&#383;ion
of his follies, and lamented the
embarra&#383;&#383;ments in which I, who merited
a far different fate, might be involved.
He be&#383;ought me to aid him with my
coun&#383;el, prai&#383;ed my under&#383;tanding, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-28_S" id="Pg_2-28_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-28.png">28</a>]</span>
appealed to the tenderne&#383;s of my
heart.</p>

<p>"This conduct only in&#383;pired me with
compa&#383;&#383;ion. I wi&#383;hed to be his friend;
but love had &#383;pread his ro&#383;y pinions,
and fled far, far away; and had not
(like &#383;ome exqui&#383;ite perfumes, the fine
&#383;pirit of which is continually mingling
with the air) left a fragrance behind,
to mark where he had &#383;hook his wings.
My hu&#383;band's renewed care&#383;&#383;es then
became hateful to me; his brutality
was tolerable, compared to his di&#383;ta&#383;teful
fondne&#383;s. Still, compa&#383;&#383;ion, and
the fear of in&#383;ulting his &#383;uppo&#383;ed feelings,
by a want of &#383;ympathy, made
me di&#383;&#383;emble, and do violence to my
delicacy. What a ta&#383;k!</p>

<p>"Tho&#383;e who &#383;upport a &#383;y&#383;tem of
what I term fal&#383;e refinement, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-29_S" id="Pg_2-29_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-29.png">29</a>]</span>
not allow great part of love in the female,
as well as male brea&#383;t, to &#383;pring
in &#383;ome re&#383;pects involuntarily, may not
admit that charms are as nece&#383;&#383;ary to
feed the pa&#383;&#383;ion, as virtues to convert
the mellowing &#383;pirit into friend&#383;hip. To
&#383;uch ob&#383;ervers I have nothing to &#383;ay,
any more than to the morali&#383;ts, who in&#383;i&#383;t
that women ought to, and can love
their hu&#383;bands, becau&#383;e it is their duty.
To you, my child, I may add, with a
heart tremblingly alive to your future
conduct, &#383;ome ob&#383;ervations, dictated
by my pre&#383;ent feelings, on calmly reviewing
this period of my life. When
noveli&#383;ts or morali&#383;ts prai&#383;e as a virtue,
a woman's coldne&#383;s of con&#383;titution, and
want of pa&#383;&#383;ion; and make her yield
to the ardour of her lover out of &#383;heer
compa&#383;&#383;ion, or to promote a frigid plan
of future comfort, I am di&#383;gu&#383;ted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-30_S" id="Pg_2-30_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-30.png">30</a>]</span>
They may be good women, in the ordinary
acceptation of the phra&#383;e, and do
no harm; but they appear to me not to
have tho&#383;e 'finely fa&#383;hioned nerves,'
which render the &#383;en&#383;es exqui&#383;ite. They
may po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s tenderne&#383;s; but they want
that fire of the imagination, which produces
<i>active</i> &#383;en&#383;ibility, and <i>po&#383;itive</i> virtue.
How does the woman de&#383;erve to
be characterized, who marries one man,
with a heart and imagination devoted
to another? Is &#383;he not an object of
pity or contempt, when thus &#383;acrilegiou&#383;ly
violating the purity of her own
feelings? Nay, it is as indelicate, when
&#383;he is indifferent, unle&#383;s &#383;he be con&#383;titutionally
in&#383;en&#383;ible; then indeed it is
a mere affair of barter; and I have nothing
to do with the &#383;ecrets of trade.
Yes; eagerly as I wi&#383;h you to po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s
true rectitude of mind, and purity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-31_S" id="Pg_2-31_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-31.png">31</a>]</span>
affection, I mu&#383;t in&#383;i&#383;t that a heartle&#383;s
conduct is the contrary of virtuous.
Truth is the only ba&#383;is of virtue; and
we cannot, without depraving our
minds, endeavour to plea&#383;e a lover or
hu&#383;band, but in proportion as he
plea&#383;es us. Men, more effectually to
en&#383;lave us, may inculcate this partial
morality, and lo&#383;e &#383;ight of virtue in
&#383;ubdividing it into the duties of particular
&#383;tations; but let us not blu&#383;h for
nature without a cau&#383;e!</p>

<p>"After the&#383;e remarks, I am a&#383;hamed
to own, that I was pregnant. The
greate&#383;t &#383;acrifice of my principles in my
whole life, was the allowing my hu&#383;band
again to be familiar with my per&#383;on,
though to this cruel act of &#383;elf-denial,
when I wi&#383;hed the earth to
open and &#383;wallow me, you owe your
birth; and I the unutterable plea&#383;ure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-32_S" id="Pg_2-32_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-32.png">32</a>]</span>
of being a mother. There was &#383;omething
of delicacy in my hu&#383;band's bridal
attentions; but now his tainted breath,
pimpled face, and blood-&#383;hot eyes,
were not more repugnant to my &#383;en&#383;es,
than his gro&#383;s manners, and lovele&#383;s
familiarity to my ta&#383;te.</p>

<p>"A man would only be expected to
maintain; yes, barely grant a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence,
to a woman rendered odious by
habitual intoxication; but who would
expect him, or think it po&#383;&#383;ible to love
her? And unle&#383;s 'youth, and genial
years were flown,' it would be thought
equally unrea&#383;onable to in&#383;i&#383;t, [under
penalty of] forfeiting almo&#383;t every thing
reckoned valuable in life, that he
&#383;hould not love another: whil&#383;t woman,
weak in rea&#383;on, impotent in will,
is required to moralize, &#383;entimentalize
her&#383;elf to &#383;tone, and pine her life away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-33_S" id="Pg_2-33_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-33.png">33</a>]</span>
labouring to reform her embruted
mate. He may even &#383;pend in di&#383;&#383;ipation,
and intemperance, the very intemperance
which renders him &#383;o hateful,
her property, and by &#383;tinting her
expences, not permit her to beguile in
&#383;ociety, a weari&#383;ome, joyle&#383;s life; for
over their mutual fortune &#383;he has no
power, it mu&#383;t all pa&#383;s through his
hand. And if &#383;he be a mother, and
in the pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of women, it is a
great mi&#383;fortune to be prevented from
di&#383;charging the duties, and cultivating
the affections of one, what has &#383;he not
to endure?&mdash;But I have &#383;uffered the
tenderne&#383;s of one to lead me into reflections
that I did not think of making,
to interrupt my narrative&mdash;yet the full
heart will overflow.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables' embarra&#383;&#383;ments did
not now endear him to me; &#383;till, anxi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-34_S" id="Pg_2-34_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-34.png">34</a>]</span>ous
to befriend him, I endeavoured to
prevail on him to retrench his expences;
but he had always &#383;ome plau&#383;ible
excu&#383;e to give, to ju&#383;tify his not
following my advice. Humanity, compa&#383;&#383;ion,
and the intere&#383;t produced by a
habit of living together, made me try
to relieve, and &#383;ympathize with him;
but, when I recollected that I was
bound to live with &#383;uch a being for
ever&mdash;my heart died within me; my
de&#383;ire of improvement became languid,
and baleful, corroding melancholy took
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of my &#383;oul. Marriage had
ba&#383;tilled me for life. I di&#383;covered in
my&#383;elf a capacity for the enjoyment of
the various plea&#383;ures exi&#383;tence affords;
yet, fettered by the partial laws of &#383;ociety,
this fair globe was to me an
univer&#383;al blank.</p>

<p>"When I exhorted my hu&#383;band to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-35_S" id="Pg_2-35_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-35.png">35</a>]</span>
economy, I referred to him&#383;elf. I was
obliged to practi&#383;e the mo&#383;t rigid, or
contract debts, which I had too much
rea&#383;on to fear would never be paid. I
de&#383;pi&#383;ed this paltry privilege of a wife,
which can only be of u&#383;e to the vicious
or incon&#383;iderate, and determined not to
increa&#383;e the torrent that was bearing
him down. I was then ignorant of
the extent of his fraudulent &#383;peculations,
whom I was bound to honour
and obey.</p>

<p>"A woman neglected by her hu&#383;band,
or who&#383;e manners form a &#383;triking
contra&#383;t with his, will always have
men on the watch to &#383;oothe and flatter
her. Be&#383;ides, the forlorn &#383;tate of a
neglected woman, not de&#383;titute of per&#383;onal
charms, is particularly intere&#383;ting,
and rou&#383;es that &#383;pecies of pity,

into love. A man of feeling thinks
not of &#383;educing, he is him&#383;elf &#383;educed
by all the noble&#383;t emotions of his &#383;oul.
He figures to him&#383;elf all the &#383;acrifices a
woman of &#383;en&#383;ibility mu&#383;t make, and
every &#383;ituation in which his imagination
places her, touches his heart,
and fires his pa&#383;&#383;ions. Longing to
take to his bo&#383;om the &#383;horn lamb, and
bid the drooping buds of hope revive,
benevolence changes into pa&#383;&#383;ion:
and &#383;hould he then di&#383;cover that he is
beloved, honour binds him fa&#383;t, though
fore&#383;eeing that he may afterwards be
obliged to pay &#383;evere damages to the
man, who never appeared to value his
wife's &#383;ociety, till he found that there
was a chance of his being indemnified
for the lo&#383;s of it.</p>

<p>"Such are the partial laws enacted
by men; for, only to lay a &#383;tre&#383;s on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-37_S" id="Pg_2-37_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-37.png">37</a>]</span>
dependent &#383;tate of a woman in the
grand que&#383;tion of the comforts ari&#383;ing
from the po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of property, &#383;he is
[even in this article] much more injured
by the lo&#383;s of the hu&#383;band's affection,
than he by that of his wife; yet where
is &#383;he, condemned to the &#383;olitude of a
de&#383;erted home, to look for a compen&#383;ation
from the woman, who &#383;educes
him from her? She cannot drive an
unfaithful hu&#383;band from his hou&#383;e, nor
&#383;eparate, or tear, his children from
him, however culpable he may be; and
he, &#383;till the ma&#383;ter of his own fate, enjoys
the &#383;miles of a world, that would
brand her with infamy, did &#383;he, &#383;eeking
con&#383;olation, venture to retaliate.</p>

<p>"The&#383;e remarks are not dictated by
experience; but merely by the compa&#383;&#383;ion
I feel for many amiable women,
the <i>out-laws</i> of the world. For my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-38_S" id="Pg_2-38_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-38.png">38</a>]</span>&#383;elf,
never encouraging any of the advances
that were made to me, my lovers
dropped off like the untimely &#383;hoots of
&#383;pring. I did not even coquet with
them; becau&#383;e I found, on examining
my&#383;elf, I could not coquet with a man
without loving him a little; and I perceived
that I &#383;hould not be able to
&#383;top at the line of what are termed <i>innocent
freedoms</i>, did I &#383;uffer any. My
re&#383;erve was then the con&#383;equence of
delicacy. Freedom of conduct has
emancipated many women's minds;
but my conduct has mo&#383;t rigidly been
governed by my principles, till the improvement
of my under&#383;tanding has
enabled me to di&#383;cern the fallacy of
prejudices at war with nature and
rea&#383;on.</p>

<p>"Shortly after the change I have
mentioned in my hu&#383;band's conduct,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-39_S" id="Pg_2-39_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-39.png">39</a>]</span>
my uncle was compelled by his declining
health, to &#383;eek the &#383;uccour of a
milder climate, and embark for Li&#383;bon.
He left his will in the hands of a friend,
an eminent &#383;olicitor; he had previou&#383;ly
que&#383;tioned me relative to my &#383;ituation
and &#383;tate of mind, and declared very
freely, that he could place no reliance
on the &#383;tability of my hu&#383;band's profe&#383;&#383;ions.
He had been deceived in the
unfolding of his character; he now
thought it fixed in a train of actions
that would inevitably lead to ruin and
di&#383;grace.</p>

<p>"The evening before his departure,
which we &#383;pent alone together, he
folded me to his heart, uttering the endearing
appellation of 'child.'&mdash;My
more than father! why was I not permitted
to perform the la&#383;t duties of
one, and &#383;mooth the pillow of death?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-40_S" id="Pg_2-40_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-40.png">40</a>]</span>
He &#383;eemed by his manner to be convinced
that he &#383;hould never &#383;ee me
more; yet reque&#383;ted me, mo&#383;t earne&#383;tly,
to come to him, &#383;hould I be obliged to
leave my hu&#383;band. He had before expre&#383;&#383;ed
his &#383;orrow at hearing of my
pregnancy, having determined to prevail
on me to accompany him, till I
informed him of that circum&#383;tance. He
expre&#383;&#383;ed him&#383;elf unfeignedly &#383;orry that
any new tie &#383;hould bind me to a man
whom he thought &#383;o incapable of e&#383;timating
my value; &#383;uch was the kind
language of affection.</p>

<p>"I mu&#383;t repeat his own words; they
made an indelible impre&#383;&#383;ion on my
mind:</p>

<p>"'The marriage &#383;tate is certainly that
in which women, generally &#383;peaking,
can be mo&#383;t u&#383;eful; but I am far from
thinking that a woman, once married,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-41_S" id="Pg_2-41_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-41.png">41</a>]</span>
ought to con&#383;ider the engagement as
indi&#383;&#383;oluble (e&#383;pecially if there be no
children to reward her for &#383;acrificing
her feelings) in ca&#383;e her hu&#383;band
merits neither her love, nor e&#383;teem.
E&#383;teem will often &#383;upply the place of
love; and prevent a woman from being
wretched, though it may not
make her happy. The magnitude of
a &#383;acrifice ought always to bear &#383;ome
proportion to the utility in view;
and for a woman to live with a man,
for whom &#383;he can cheri&#383;h neither affection
nor e&#383;teem, or even be of any
u&#383;e to him, excepting in the light of
a hou&#383;e-keeper, is an abjectne&#383;s of
condition, the enduring of which no
concurrence of circum&#383;tances can
ever make a duty in the &#383;ight of God
or ju&#383;t men. If indeed &#383;he &#383;ubmits to
it merely to be maintained in idlene&#383;s,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-42_S" id="Pg_2-42_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-42.png">42</a>]</span>
&#383;he has no right to complain bitterly
of her fate; or to act, as a per&#383;on of
independent character might, as if
&#383;he had a title to di&#383;regard general
rules.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins>But the mi&#383;fortune is, that many
women only &#383;ubmit in appearance,
and forfeit their own re&#383;pect to &#383;ecure
their reputation in the world. The
&#383;ituation of a woman &#383;eparated from
her hu&#383;band, is undoubtedly very different
from that of a man who has
left his wife. He, with lordly dignity,
has &#383;haken of a clog; and the allowing
her food and raiment, is
thought &#383;ufficient to &#383;ecure his reputation
from taint. And, &#383;hould &#383;he
have been incon&#383;iderate, he will be
celebrated for his genero&#383;ity and forbearance.

the independence of mind di&#383;tinctive
of a rational being, and &#383;purning at
&#383;lavery.'</p>

<p>"During the remainder of the evening,
my uncle's tenderne&#383;s led him frequently
to revert to the &#383;ubject, and
utter, with increa&#383;ing warmth, &#383;entiments
to the &#383;ame purport. At length
it was nece&#383;&#383;ary to &#383;ay 'Farewell!'&mdash;and

<h2><a name="CHAP_XI_S" id="CHAP_XI_S"></a>CHAP. XI.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of large fortune
and of poli&#383;hed manners, had lately
vi&#383;ited very frequently at our hou&#383;e,
and treated me, if po&#383;&#383;ible, with more
re&#383;pect than Mr. Venables paid him;
my pregnancy was not yet vi&#383;ible,
his &#383;ociety was a great relief to me, as
I had for &#383;ome time pa&#383;t, to avoid expence,
confined my&#383;elf very much at
home. I ever di&#383;dained unnece&#383;&#383;ary,
perhaps even prudent concealments;
and my hu&#383;band, with great ea&#383;e, di&#383;covered
the amount of my uncle's parting
pre&#383;ent. A copy of a writ was the
&#383;tale pretext to extort it from me; and
I had &#383;oon rea&#383;on to believe that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-45_S" id="Pg_2-45_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-45.png">45</a>]</span>
fabricated for the purpo&#383;e. I acknowledge
my folly in thus &#383;uffering my&#383;elf
to be continually impo&#383;ed on. I had
adhered to my re&#383;olution not to apply
to my uncle, on the part of my hu&#383;band,
any more; yet, when I had received
a &#383;um &#383;ufficient to &#383;upply my own
wants, and to enable me to pur&#383;ue a
plan I had in view, to &#383;ettle my younger
brother in a re&#383;pectable employment,
I allowed my&#383;elf to be duped by
Mr. Venables' &#383;hallow pretences, and
hypocritical profe&#383;&#383;ions.</p>

<p>"Thus did he pillage me and my
family, thus fru&#383;trate all my plans of
u&#383;efulne&#383;s. Yet this was the man I was
bound to re&#383;pect and e&#383;teem: as if re&#383;pect
and e&#383;teem depended on an arbitrary
will of our own! But a wife being
as much a man's property as his
hor&#383;e, or his a&#383;s, &#383;he has nothing &#383;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-46_S" id="Pg_2-46_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-46.png">46</a>]</span>
can call her own. He may u&#383;e any
means to get at what the law con&#383;iders
as his, the moment his wife is in
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of it, even to the forcing of
a lock, as Mr. Venables did, to &#383;earch
for notes in my writing-de&#383;k&mdash;and all
this is done with a &#383;how of equity, becau&#383;e,
for&#383;ooth, he is re&#383;pon&#383;ible for
her maintenance.</p>

<p>"The tender mother cannot <i>lawfully</i>
&#383;natch from the gripe of the
gambling &#383;pendthrift, or bea&#383;tly
drunkard, unmindful of his off&#383;pring,
the fortune which falls to her by
chance; or (&#383;o flagrant is the inju&#383;tice)
what &#383;he earns by her own exertions.
No; he can rob her with impunity,
even to wa&#383;te publicly on a courtezan;
and the laws of her country&mdash;if women
have a country&mdash;afford her no protection
or redre&#383;s from the oppre&#383;&#383;or, un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-47_S" id="Pg_2-47_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-47.png">47</a>]</span>le&#383;s
&#383;he have the plea of bodily fear;
yet how many ways are there of goading
the &#383;oul almo&#383;t to madne&#383;s, equally
unmanly, though not &#383;o mean? When
&#383;uch laws were framed, &#383;hould not
impartial lawgivers have fir&#383;t decreed,
in the &#383;tyle of a great a&#383;&#383;embly, who recognized
the exi&#383;tence of an <i>&ecirc;tre &#383;upr&ecirc;me</i>,
to fix the national belief, that
the hu&#383;band &#383;hould always be wi&#383;er and
more virtuous than his wife, in order
to entitle him, with a &#383;how of ju&#383;tice,
to keep this idiot, or perpetual minor,
for ever in bondage. But I mu&#383;t have
done&mdash;on this &#383;ubject, my indignation
continually runs away with me.</p>

<p>"The company of the gentleman I
have already mentioned, who had a
general acquaintance with literature
and &#383;ubjects of ta&#383;te, was grateful to
me; my countenance brightened up as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-48_S" id="Pg_2-48_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-48.png">48</a>]</span>
he approached, and I unaffectedly
expre&#383;&#383;ed the plea&#383;ure I felt. The
amu&#383;ement his conver&#383;ation afforded
me, made it ea&#383;y to comply with my
hu&#383;band's reque&#383;t, to endeavour to render
our hou&#383;e agreeable to him.</p>

<p>"His attentions became more
pointed; but, as I was not of the
number of women, who&#383;e virtue, as
it is termed, immediately takes alarm,
I endeavoured, rather by raillery than
&#383;erious expo&#383;tulation, to give a different
turn to his conver&#383;ation. He a&#383;&#383;umed a
new mode of attack, and I was, for a
while, the dupe of his pretended
friend&#383;hip.</p>

<p>"I had, merely in the &#383;tyle of <i>badinage</i>,
boa&#383;ted of my conque&#383;t, and repeated
his lover-like compliments to
my hu&#383;band. But he begged me, for
God's &#383;ake, not to affront his friend, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-49_S" id="Pg_2-49_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-49.png">49</a>]</span>
I &#383;hould de&#383;troy all his projects, and be
his ruin. Had I had more affection for
my hu&#383;band, I &#383;hould have expre&#383;&#383;ed
my contempt of this time-&#383;erving politene&#383;s:
now I imagined that I only
felt pity; yet it would have puzzled a
ca&#383;ui&#383;t to point out in what the exact
difference con&#383;i&#383;ted.</p>

<p>"This friend began now, in confidence,
to di&#383;cover to me the real &#383;tate
of my hu&#383;band's affairs. 'Nece&#383;&#383;ity,'
&#383;aid Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;; why &#383;hould I reveal
his name? for he affected to palliate the
conduct he could not excu&#383;e, 'had
led him to take &#383;uch &#383;teps, by accommodation
bills, buying goods on credit,
to &#383;ell them for ready money, and &#383;imilar
tran&#383;actions, that his character in
the commercial world was gone. He
was con&#383;idered,' he added, lowering
his voice, 'on 'Change as a &#383;windler.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-50_S" id="Pg_2-50_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-50.png">50</a>]</span>
"I felt at that moment the fir&#383;t maternal
pang. Aware of the evils my
&#383;ex have to &#383;truggle with, I &#383;till wi&#383;hed,
for my own con&#383;olation, to be the mother
of a daughter; and I could not
bear to think, that the <i>&#383;ins</i> of her father's
entailed di&#383;grace, &#383;hould be added
to the ills to which woman is heir.</p>

<p>"So completely was I deceived by
the&#383;e &#383;hows of friend&#383;hip (nay, I believe,
according to his interpretation, Mr. S&mdash;
really was my friend) that I began
to con&#383;ult him re&#383;pecting the be&#383;t mode
of retrieving my hu&#383;band's character:
it is the good name of a woman only
that &#383;ets to ri&#383;e no more. I knew
not that he had been drawn into a
whirlpool, out of which he had not
the energy to attempt to e&#383;cape. He
&#383;eemed indeed de&#383;titute of the power
of employing his faculties in any regu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-51_S" id="Pg_2-51_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-51.png">51</a>]</span>lar
pur&#383;uit. His principles of action
were &#383;o loo&#383;e, and his mind &#383;o uncultivated,
that every thing like order appeared
to him in the &#383;hape of re&#383;traint;
and, like men in the &#383;avage &#383;tate, he
required the &#383;trong &#383;timulus of hope
or fear, produced by wild &#383;peculations,
in which the intere&#383;ts of others went
for nothing, to keep his &#383;pirits awake.
He one time po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed patrioti&#383;m, but
he knew not what it was to feel hone&#383;t
indignation; and pretended to be an advocate
for liberty, when, with as little
affection for the human race as for individuals,
he thought of nothing but
his own gratification. He was ju&#383;t
&#383;uch a citizen, as a father. The &#383;ums
he adroitly obtained by a violation of
the laws of his country, as well as
tho&#383;e of humanity, he would allow a
mi&#383;tre&#383;s to &#383;quander; though &#383;he was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-52_S" id="Pg_2-52_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-52.png">52</a>]</span>
with the &#383;ame <i>&#383;ang froid</i>, con&#383;igned, as
were his children, to poverty, when
another proved more attractive.</p>

<p>"On various pretences, his friend
continued to vi&#383;it me; and, ob&#383;erving
my want of money, he tried to induce
me to accept of pecuniary aid; but this
offer I ab&#383;olutely rejected, though it
was made with &#383;uch delicacy, I could
not be di&#383;plea&#383;ed.</p>

<p>"One day he came, as I thought
accidentally, to dinner. My hu&#383;band
was very much engaged in bu&#383;ine&#383;s,
and quitted the room &#383;oon after the
cloth was removed. We conver&#383;ed as
u&#383;ual, till confidential advice led again
to love. I was extremely mortified.
I had a &#383;incere regard for him, and
hoped that he had an equal friend&#383;hip
for me. I therefore began mildly to
expo&#383;tulate with him. This gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-53_S" id="Pg_2-53_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-53.png">53</a>]</span>ne&#383;s
he mi&#383;took for coy encouragement;
and he would not be diverted
from the &#383;ubject. Perceiving his mi&#383;take,
I &#383;eriou&#383;ly a&#383;ked him how, u&#383;ing
&#383;uch language to me, he could profe&#383;s
to be my hu&#383;band's friend? A &#383;ignificant
&#383;neer excited my curio&#383;ity, and he,
&#383;uppo&#383;ing this to be my only &#383;cruple,
took a letter deliberately out of his
pocket, &#383;aying, 'Your hu&#383;band's honour
is not inflexible. How could you,
with your di&#383;cernment, think it &#383;o?
Why, he left the room this very day
on purpo&#383;e to give me an opportunity
to explain my&#383;elf; <i>he</i> thought me too
timid&mdash;too tardy.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins></p>

<p>"I &#383;natched the letter with inde&#383;cribable
emotion. The purport of it
was to invite him to dinner, and to ridicule
his chivalrous re&#383;pect for me.
He a&#383;&#383;ured him, 'that every woman had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-54_S" id="Pg_2-54_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-54.png">54</a>]</span>
her price, and, with gro&#383;s indecency,
hinted, that he &#383;hould be glad to have
the duty of a hu&#383;band taken off his
hands. The&#383;e he termed <i>liberal &#383;entiments</i>.
He advi&#383;ed him not to &#383;hock my
romantic notions, but to attack my
credulous genero&#383;ity, and weak pity;
and concluded with reque&#383;ting him to
lend him five hundred pounds for a
month or &#383;ix weeks.' I read this letter
twice over; and the firm purpo&#383;e it in&#383;pired,
calmed the ri&#383;ing tumult of my
&#383;oul. I ro&#383;e deliberately, reque&#383;ted
Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; to wait a moment, and in&#383;tantly
going into the counting-hou&#383;e,
de&#383;ired Mr. Venables to return with me
to the dining-parlour.</p>

<p>"He laid down his pen, and entered
with me, without ob&#383;erving any change
in my countenance. I &#383;hut the door,
and, giving him the letter, &#383;imply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-55_S" id="Pg_2-55_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-55.png">55</a>]</span>
a&#383;ked, 'whether he wrote it, or was it
a forgery?'</p>

<p>"Nothing could equal his confu&#383;ion.
His friend's eye met his, and
he muttered &#383;omething about a joke&mdash;But
I interrupted him&mdash;'It is &#383;ufficient&mdash;We
part for ever.'</p>

<p>"I continued, with &#383;olemnity, 'I
have borne with your tyranny and infidelities.
I di&#383;dain to utter what I
have borne with. I thought you unprincipled,
but not &#383;o decidedly
vicious. I formed a tie, in the &#383;ight of
heaven&mdash;I have held it &#383;acred; even
when men, more conformable to my
ta&#383;te, have made me feel&mdash;I de&#383;pi&#383;e all
&#383;ubterfuge!&mdash;that I was not dead to
love. Neglected by you, I have re&#383;olutely
&#383;tifled the enticing emotions, and
re&#383;pected the plighted faith you outraged.
And you dare now to in&#383;ult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-56_S" id="Pg_2-56_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-56.png">56</a>]</span>
me, by &#383;elling me to pro&#383;titution!&mdash;Yes&mdash;equally
lo&#383;t to delicacy and principle&mdash;you
dared &#383;acrilegiou&#383;ly to barter
the honour of the mother of your
child.'</p>

<p>"Then, turning to Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, I
added, 'I call on you, Sir, to witne&#383;s,'
and I lifted my hands and eyes to heaven,
'that, as &#383;olemnly as I took his
name, I now abjure it,' I pulled off my
ring, and put it on the table; 'and that
I mean immediately to quit his hou&#383;e,
never to enter it more. I will provide
for my&#383;elf and child. I leave him as
free as I am determined to be my&#383;elf&mdash;he
&#383;hall be an&#383;werable for no debts of
mine.'</p>

<p>"A&#383;toni&#383;hment clo&#383;ed their lips, till
Mr. Venables, gently pu&#383;hing his
friend, with a forced &#383;mile, out of the
room, nature for a moment prevailed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-57_S" id="Pg_2-57_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-57.png">57</a>]</span>
and, appearing like him&#383;elf, he turned
round, burning with rage, to me:
but there was no terror in the frown,
excepting when contra&#383;ted with the
malignant &#383;mile which preceded it.
He bade me 'leave the hou&#383;e at my
peril; told me he de&#383;pi&#383;ed my threats;
I had no re&#383;ource; I could not &#383;wear the
peace again&#383;t him!&mdash;I was not afraid of
my life!&mdash;he had never &#383;truck me!'</p>

<p>"He threw the letter in the fire,
which I had incautiou&#383;ly left in his
hands; and, quitting the room, locked
the door on me.</p>

<p>"When left alone, I was a moment
or two before I could recollect my&#383;elf.
One &#383;cene had &#383;ucceeded another with
&#383;uch rapidity, I almo&#383;t doubted whether
I was reflecting on a real event.
'Was it po&#383;&#383;ible? Was I, indeed,
free?'&mdash;Yes; free I termed my&#383;elf,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-58_S" id="Pg_2-58_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-58.png">58</a>]</span>
when I decidedly perceived the conduct
I ought to adopt. How had I panted
for liberty&mdash;liberty, that I would have
purcha&#383;ed at any price, but that of my
own e&#383;teem! I ro&#383;e, and &#383;hook my&#383;elf;
opened the window, and methought
the air never &#383;melled &#383;o &#383;weet. The face
of heaven grew fairer as I viewed it,
and the clouds &#383;eemed to flit away obedient
to my wi&#383;hes, to give my &#383;oul
room to expand. I was all &#383;oul, and
(wild as it may appear) felt as if I
could have di&#383;&#383;olved in the &#383;oft balmy
gale that ki&#383;&#383;ed my cheek, or have
glided below the horizon on the glowing,
de&#383;cending beams. A &#383;eraphic &#383;ati&#383;faction
animated, without agitating
my &#383;pirits; and my imagination collected,
in vi&#383;ions &#383;ublimely terrible, or
&#383;oothingly beautiful, an immen&#383;e variety
of the endle&#383;s images, which nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-59_S" id="Pg_2-59_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-59.png">59</a>]</span>
affords, and fancy combines, of the
grand and fair. The lu&#383;tre of the&#383;e
bright picture&#383;que &#383;ketches faded with
the &#383;etting &#383;un; but I was &#383;till alive to
the calm delight they had diffu&#383;ed
through my heart.</p>

<p>"There may be advocates for matrimonial
obedience, who, making a di&#383;tinction
between the duty of a wife and
of a human being, may blame my conduct.&mdash;To
them I write not&mdash;my feelings
are not for them to analyze; and
may you, my child, never be able to
a&#383;certain, by heart-rending experience,
what your mother felt before the pre&#383;ent
emancipation of her mind!</p>

<p>"I began to write a letter to my father,
after clo&#383;ing one to my uncle;
not to a&#383;k advice, but to &#383;ignify my determination;
when I was interrupted
by the entrance of Mr. Venables. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-60_S" id="Pg_2-60_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-60.png">60</a>]</span>
manner was changed. His views on
my uncle's fortune made him aver&#383;e to
my quitting his hou&#383;e, or he would, I
am convinced, have been glad to have
&#383;haken off even the &#383;light re&#383;traint my
pre&#383;ence impo&#383;ed on him; the re&#383;traint
of &#383;howing me &#383;ome re&#383;pect. So far
from having an affection for me, he
really hated me, becau&#383;e he was convinced
that I mu&#383;t de&#383;pi&#383;e him.</p>

<p>"He told me, that, 'As I now had
had time to cool and reflect, he did not
doubt but that my prudence, and nice
&#383;en&#383;e of propriety, would lead me to
overlook what was pa&#383;&#383;ed.'</p>

<p>"'Reflection,' I replied, 'had only
confirmed my purpo&#383;e, and no power
on earth could divert me from it.'</p>

<p>"Endeavouring to a&#383;&#383;ume a &#383;oothing
voice and look, when he would willingly
have tortured me, to force me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-61_S" id="Pg_2-61_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-61.png">61</a>]</span>
feel his power, his countenance had an
infernal expre&#383;&#383;ion, when he de&#383;ired me,
'Not to expo&#383;e my&#383;elf to the &#383;ervants,
by obliging him to confine me in my
apartment; if then I would give my
promi&#383;e not to quit the hou&#383;e precipitately,
I &#383;hould be free&mdash;and&mdash;.' I declared,
interrupting him, 'that I would
promi&#383;e nothing. I had no mea&#383;ures
to keep with him&mdash;I was re&#383;olved, and
would not conde&#383;cend to &#383;ubterfuge.'</p>

<p>"He muttered, 'that I &#383;hould &#383;oon
repent of the&#383;e prepo&#383;terous airs;' and,
ordering tea to be carried into my little
&#383;tudy, which had a communication with
my bed-chamber, he once more locked
the door upon me, and left me to my
own meditations. I had pa&#383;&#383;ively followed
him up &#383;tairs, not wi&#383;hing to fatigue
my&#383;elf with unavailing exertion.</p>

<p>"Nothing calms the mind like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-62_S" id="Pg_2-62_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-62.png">62</a>]</span>
fixed purpo&#383;e. I felt as if I had heaved
a thou&#383;and weight from my heart; the
atmo&#383;phere &#383;eemed lightened; and, if
I execrated the in&#383;titutions of &#383;ociety,
which thus enable men to tyrannize
over women, it was almo&#383;t a di&#383;intere&#383;ted
&#383;entiment. I di&#383;regarded pre&#383;ent
inconveniences, when my mind had
done &#383;truggling with it&#383;elf,&mdash;when rea&#383;on
and inclination had &#383;haken hands
and were at peace. I had no longer
the cruel ta&#383;k before me, in endle&#383;s per&#383;pective,
aye, during the tedious
for ever of life, of labouring to
overcome my repugnance&mdash;of labouring
to extingui&#383;h the hopes, the maybes
of a lively imagination. Death I
had hailed as my only chance for deliverance;
but, while exi&#383;tence had &#383;till
&#383;o many charms, and life promi&#383;ed
happine&#383;s, I &#383;hrunk from the icy arms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-63_S" id="Pg_2-63_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-63.png">63</a>]</span>
of an unknown tyrant, though far more
inviting than tho&#383;e of the man, to whom I
&#383;uppo&#383;ed my&#383;elf bound without any other
alternative; and was content to linger
a little longer, waiting for I knew not
what, rather than leave 'the warm
precincts of the cheerful day,' and all
the unenjoyed affection of my nature.</p>

<p>"My pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation gave a new
turn to my reflection; and I wondered
(now the film &#383;eemed to be withdrawn,
that ob&#383;cured the piercing &#383;ight of rea&#383;on)
how I could, previou&#383;ly to the deciding
outrage, have con&#383;idered my&#383;elf
as everla&#383;tingly united to vice and folly?
'Had an evil genius ca&#383;t a &#383;pell at my
birth; or a demon &#383;talked out of chaos,
to perplex my under&#383;tanding, and enchain
my will, with delu&#383;ive prejudices?'</p>

<p>"I pur&#383;ued this train of thinking; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-64_S" id="Pg_2-64_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-64.png">64</a>]</span>
led me out of my&#383;elf, to expatiate on
the mi&#383;ery peculiar to my &#383;ex. 'Are
not,' I thought, 'the de&#383;pots for ever
&#383;tigmatized, who, in the wantonne&#383;s of
power, commanded even the mo&#383;t atrocious
criminals to be chained to dead
bodies? though &#383;urely tho&#383;e laws are
much more inhuman, which forge adamantine
fetters to bind minds together,
that never can mingle in &#383;ocial communion!
What indeed can equal the
wretchedne&#383;s of that &#383;tate, in which
there is no alternative, but to extingui&#383;h
the affections, or encounter infamy?'</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Towards</span> midnight Mr. Venables
entered my chamber; and, with
calm audacity preparing to go to bed,
he bade me make ha&#383;te, 'for that was
the be&#383;t place for hu&#383;bands and wives
to end their differences. He had been
drinking plentifully to aid his courage.</p>

<p>"I did not at fir&#383;t deign to reply.
But perceiving that he affected to take
my &#383;ilence for con&#383;ent, I told him that,
'If he would not go to another bed, or
allow me, I &#383;hould &#383;it up in my &#383;tudy
all night.' He attempted to pull me
into the chamber, half joking. But I
re&#383;i&#383;ted; and, as he had determined not
to give me any rea&#383;on for &#383;aying that
he u&#383;ed violence, after a few more ef<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-66_S" id="Pg_2-66_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-66.png">66</a>]</span>forts,
he retired, cur&#383;ing my ob&#383;tinacy,
to bed.</p>

<p>"I &#383;at mu&#383;ing &#383;ome time longer; then,
throwing my cloak around me, prepared
for &#383;leep on a &#383;opha. And, &#383;o fortunate
&#383;eemed my deliverance, &#383;o &#383;acred
the plea&#383;ure of being thus wrapped up
in my&#383;elf, that I &#383;lept profoundly, and
woke with a mind compo&#383;ed to encounter
the &#383;truggles of the day. Mr.
Venables did not wake till &#383;ome hours
after; and then he came to me half-dre&#383;&#383;ed,
yawning and &#383;tretching, with
haggard eyes, as if he &#383;carcely recollected
what had pa&#383;&#383;ed the preceding
evening. He fixed his eyes on me for
a moment, then, calling me a fool,
a&#383;ked 'How long I intended to continue
this pretty farce? For his part, he
was devili&#383;h &#383;ick of it; but this was the
plague of marrying women who pretended
to know &#383;omething.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-67_S" id="Pg_2-67_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-67.png">67</a>]</span>
"I made no other reply to this harangue,
than to &#383;ay, 'That he ought to
be glad to get rid of a woman &#383;o unfit
to be his companion&mdash;and that any
change in my conduct would be mean
di&#383;&#383;imulation; for maturer reflection
only gave the &#383;acred &#383;eal of rea&#383;on to
my fir&#383;t re&#383;olution.'</p>

<p>"He looked as if he could have
&#383;tamped with impatience, at being
obliged to &#383;tifle his rage; but, conquering
his anger (for weak people, who&#383;e
pa&#383;&#383;ions &#383;eem the mo&#383;t ungovernable,
re&#383;train them with the greate&#383;t ea&#383;e,
when they have a &#383;ufficient motive), he
exclaimed, 'Very pretty, upon my
&#383;oul! very pretty, theatrical flouri&#383;hes!
Pray, fair Roxana, &#383;toop from your altitudes,
and remember that you are
acting a part in real life.'</p>

<p>"He uttered this &#383;peech with a &#383;elf-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-68_S" id="Pg_2-68_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-68.png">68</a>]</span>&#383;ati&#383;fied
air, and went down &#383;tairs to
dre&#383;s.</p>

<p>"In about an hour he came to me
again; and in the &#383;ame tone &#383;aid, 'That
he came as my gentleman-u&#383;her to hand
me down to breakfa&#383;t.</p>

<p>"'Of the black rod?' a&#383;ked I.</p>

<p>"This que&#383;tion, and the tone in
which I a&#383;ked it, a little di&#383;concerted
him. To &#383;ay the truth, I now felt no
re&#383;entment; my firm re&#383;olution to free
my&#383;elf from my ignoble thraldom, had
ab&#383;orbed the various emotions which,
during &#383;ix years, had racked my &#383;oul.
The duty pointed out by my principles
&#383;eemed clear; and not one tender feeling
intruded to make me &#383;werve: The
di&#383;like which my hu&#383;band had in&#383;pired
was &#383;trong; but it only led me to wi&#383;h
to avoid, to wi&#383;h to let him drop out of
my memory; there was no mi&#383;ery, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-69_S" id="Pg_2-69_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-69.png">69</a>]</span>
torture that I would not deliberately
have cho&#383;en, rather than renew my
lea&#383;e of &#383;ervitude.</p>

<p>"During the breakfa&#383;t, he attempted
to rea&#383;on with me on the folly of romantic
&#383;entiments; for this was the indi&#383;criminate
epithet he gave to every
mode of conduct or thinking &#383;uperior
to his own. He a&#383;&#383;erted, 'that all the
world were governed by their own intere&#383;t;
tho&#383;e who pretended to be actuated
by different motives, were only
deeper knaves, or fools crazed by books,
who took for go&#383;pel all the rodomantade
non&#383;en&#383;e written by men who
knew nothing of the world. For his
part, he thanked God, he was no hypocrite;
and, if he &#383;tretched a point
&#383;ometimes, it was always with an intention
of paying every man his own.'</p>

<p>"He then artfully in&#383;inuated, 'that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-70_S" id="Pg_2-70_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-70.png">70</a>]</span>
he daily expected a ve&#383;&#383;el to arrive, a
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful &#383;peculation, that would make
him ea&#383;y for the pre&#383;ent, and that he
had &#383;everal other &#383;chemes actually depending,
that could not fail. He had
no doubt of becoming rich in a few
years, though he had been thrown back
by &#383;ome unlucky adventures at the &#383;etting
out.'</p>

<p>"I mildly replied, 'That I wi&#383;hed he
might not involve him&#383;elf &#383;till deeper.'</p>

<p>"He had no notion that I was governed
by a deci&#383;ion of judgment, not
to be compared with a mere &#383;purt of
re&#383;entment. He knew not what it was
to feel indignation again&#383;t vice, and
often boa&#383;ted of his placable temper,
and readine&#383;s to forgive injuries. True;
for he only con&#383;idered the being deceived,
as an effort of &#383;kill he had not
guarded again&#383;t; and then, with a cant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-71_S" id="Pg_2-71_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-71.png">71</a>]</span>
of candour, would ob&#383;erve, 'that he
did not know how he might him&#383;elf
have been tempted to act in the &#383;ame
circum&#383;tances.' And, as his heart
never opened to friend&#383;hip, it never was
wounded by di&#383;appointment. Every
new acquaintance he prote&#383;ted, it is
true, was 'the clevere&#383;t fellow in the
world;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins> and he really thought &#383;o; till
the novelty of his conver&#383;ation or manners
cea&#383;ed to have any effect on his
&#383;luggi&#383;h &#383;pirits. His re&#383;pect for rank or
fortune was more permanent, though
he chanced to have no de&#383;ign of availing
him&#383;elf of the influence of either
to promote his own views.</p>

<p>"After a prefatory conver&#383;ation,&mdash;my
blood (I thought it had been cooler)
flu&#383;hed over my whole countenance as
he &#383;poke&mdash;he alluded to my &#383;ituation.
He de&#383;ired me to reflect&mdash;'and act like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-72_S" id="Pg_2-72_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-72.png">72</a>]</span>
a prudent woman, as the be&#383;t proof of
my &#383;uperior under&#383;tanding; for he mu&#383;t
own I had &#383;en&#383;e, did I know how to
u&#383;e it. I was not,' he laid a &#383;tre&#383;s on
his words, 'without my pa&#383;&#383;ions; and
a hu&#383;band was a convenient cloke.&mdash;He
was liberal in his way of thinking;
and why might not we, like many other
married people, who were above vulgar
prejudices, tacitly con&#383;ent to let
each other follow their own inclination?&mdash;He
meant nothing more, in the
letter I made the ground of complaint;
and the plea&#383;ure which I &#383;eemed to
take in Mr. S.'s company, led him to
conclude, that he was not di&#383;agreeable
to me.'</p>

<p>"A clerk brought in the letters of
the day, and I, as I often did, while
he was di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing &#383;ubjects of bu&#383;ine&#383;s,
went to the <i>piano forte</i>, and began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-73_S" id="Pg_2-73_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-73.png">73</a>]</span>
play a favourite air to re&#383;tore my&#383;elf,
as it were, to nature, and drive the
&#383;ophi&#383;ticated &#383;entiments I had ju&#383;t been
obliged to li&#383;ten to, out of my &#383;oul.</p>

<p>"They had excited &#383;en&#383;ations &#383;imilar
to tho&#383;e I have felt, in viewing the &#383;qualid
inhabitants of &#383;ome of the lanes and
back &#383;treets of the metropolis, mortified
at being compelled to con&#383;ider
them as my fellow-creatures, as if an
ape had claimed kindred with me. Or,
as when &#383;urrounded by a mephitical fog,
I have wi&#383;hed to have a volley of cannon
fired, to clear the incumbered atmo&#383;phere,
and give me room to breathe
and move.</p>

<p>"My &#383;pirits were all in arms, and I
played a kind of extemporary prelude.
The cadence was probably wild and
impa&#383;&#383;ioned, while, lo&#383;t in thought, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-74_S" id="Pg_2-74_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-74.png">74</a>]</span>
made the &#383;ounds a kind of echo to my
train of thinking.</p>

<p>"Pau&#383;ing for a moment, I met Mr.
Venables' eyes. He was ob&#383;erving me
with an air of conceited &#383;ati&#383;faction, as
much as to &#383;ay&mdash;'My la&#383;t in&#383;inuation
has done the bu&#383;ine&#383;s&mdash;&#383;he begins to
know her own intere&#383;t.' Then gathering
up his letters, he &#383;aid, 'That
he hoped he &#383;hould hear no more romantic
&#383;tuff, well enough in a mi&#383;s
ju&#383;t come from boarding &#383;chool;' and
went, as was his cu&#383;tom, to the counting-hou&#383;e.
I &#383;till continued playing;
and, turning to a &#383;prightly le&#383;&#383;on, I
executed it with uncommon vivacity.
I heard foot&#383;teps approach the door,
and was &#383;oon convinced that Mr. Venables
was li&#383;tening; the con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s
only gave more animation to my
fingers. He went down into the kit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-75_S" id="Pg_2-75_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-75.png">75</a>]</span>chen,
and the cook, probably by his
de&#383;ire, came to me, to know what I
would plea&#383;e to order for dinner. Mr.
Venables came into the parlour again,
with apparent carele&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s. I perceived
that the cunning man was over-reaching
him&#383;elf; and I gave my directions
as u&#383;ual, and left the room.</p>

<p>"While I was making &#383;ome alteration
in my dre&#383;s, Mr. Venables peeped
in, and, begging my pardon for interrupting
me, di&#383;appeared. I took
up &#383;ome work (I could not read), and
two or three me&#383;&#383;ages were &#383;ent to me,
probably for no other purpo&#383;e, but to
enable Mr. Venables to a&#383;certain what
I was about.</p>

<p>"I li&#383;tened whenever I heard the
&#383;treet-door open; at la&#383;t I imagined I
could di&#383;tingui&#383;h Mr. Venables' &#383;tep,
going out. I laid a&#383;ide my work; my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-76_S" id="Pg_2-76_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-76.png">76</a>]</span>
heart palpitated; &#383;till I was afraid
ha&#383;tily to enquire; and I waited a long
half hour, before I ventured to a&#383;k the
boy whether his ma&#383;ter was in the
counting-hou&#383;e?</p>

<p>"Being an&#383;wered in the negative,
I bade him call me a coach, and collecting
a few nece&#383;&#383;aries ha&#383;tily together,
with a little parcel of letters and
papers which I had collected the preceding
evening, I hurried into it, de&#383;iring
the coachman to drive to a di&#383;tant
part of the town.</p>

<p>"I almo&#383;t feared that the coach
would break down before I got out of
the &#383;treet; and, when I turned the
corner, I &#383;eemed to breathe a freer air.
I was ready to imagine that I was ri&#383;ing
above the thick atmo&#383;phere of earth;
or I felt, as wearied &#383;ouls might be &#383;up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-77_S" id="Pg_2-77_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-77.png">77</a>]</span>po&#383;ed
to feel on entering another &#383;tate
of exi&#383;tence.</p>

<p>"I &#383;topped at one or two &#383;tands of
coaches to elude pur&#383;uit, and then
drove round the &#383;kirts of the town to
&#383;eek for an ob&#383;cure lodging, where I
wi&#383;hed to remain concealed, till I could
avail my&#383;elf of my uncle's protection.
I had re&#383;olved to a&#383;&#383;ume my own name
immediately, and openly to avow my
determination, without any formal vindication,
the moment I had found a
home, in which I could re&#383;t free from
the daily alarm of expecting to &#383;ee
Mr. Venables enter.</p>

<p>"I looked at &#383;everal lodgings; but
finding that I could not, without a reference
to &#383;ome acquaintance, who
might inform my tyrant, get admittance
into a decent apartment&mdash;men
have not all this trouble&mdash;I thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-78_S" id="Pg_2-78_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-78.png">78</a>]</span>
a woman whom I had a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted to furni&#383;h
a little haberda&#383;her's &#383;hop, and
who I knew had a fir&#383;t floor to let.</p>

<p>"I went to her, and though I could
not per&#383;uade her, that the quarrel between
me and Mr. Venables would
never be made up, &#383;till &#383;he agreed to
conceal me for the pre&#383;ent; yet a&#383;&#383;uring
me at the &#383;ame time, &#383;haking her
head, that, when a woman was once
married, &#383;he mu&#383;t bear every thing.
Her pale face, on which appeared a
thou&#383;and haggard lines and delving
wrinkles, produced by what is emphatically
termed fretting, inforced
her remark; and I had afterwards an
opportunity of ob&#383;erving the treatment
&#383;he had to endure, which grizzled her
into patience. She toiled from morning
till night; yet her hu&#383;band would rob
the till, and take away the money re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-79_S" id="Pg_2-79_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-79.png">79</a>]</span>&#383;erved
for paying bills; and, returning
home drunk, he would beat her if &#383;he
chanced to offend him, though &#383;he had
a child at the brea&#383;t.</p>

<p>"The&#383;e &#383;cenes awoke me at night;
and, in the morning, I heard her, as
u&#383;ual, talk to her dear Johnny&mdash;he,
for&#383;ooth, was her ma&#383;ter; no &#383;lave in
the We&#383;t Indies had one more de&#383;potic;
but fortunately &#383;he was of the
true Ru&#383;&#383;ian breed of wives.</p>

<p>"My mind, during the few pa&#383;t
days, &#383;eemed, as it were, di&#383;engaged
from my body; but, now the &#383;truggle
was over, I felt very forcibly the effect
which perturbation of &#383;pirits produces
on a woman in my &#383;ituation.</p>

<p>"The apprehen&#383;ion of a mi&#383;carriage,
obliged me to confine my&#383;elf to
my apartment near a fortnight; but
I wrote to my uncle's friend for money,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-80_S" id="Pg_2-80_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-80.png">80</a>]</span>
promi&#383;ing 'to call on him, and explain
my &#383;ituation, when I was well enough
to go out; mean time I earne&#383;tly intreated
him, not to mention my place of
abode to any one, le&#383;t my hu&#383;band&mdash;&#383;uch
the law con&#383;idered him&mdash;&#383;hould
di&#383;turb the mind he could not conquer.
I mentioned my intention of &#383;etting out
for Li&#383;bon, to claim my uncle's protection,
the moment my health would
permit.'</p>

<p>"The tranquillity however, which
I was recovering, was &#383;oon interrupted.
My landlady came up to me one
day, with eyes &#383;wollen with weeping,
unable to utter what &#383;he was commanded
to &#383;ay. She declared, 'That
&#383;he was never &#383;o mi&#383;erable in her life;
that &#383;he mu&#383;t appear an ungrateful
mon&#383;ter; and that &#383;he would readily
go down on her knees to me, to intreat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-81_S" id="Pg_2-81_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-81.png">81</a>]</span>
me to forgive her, as &#383;he had done to
her hu&#383;band to &#383;pare her the cruel
ta&#383;k.' Sobs prevented her from proceeding,
or an&#383;wering my impatient
enquiries, to know what &#383;he meant.</p>

<p>"When &#383;he became a little more
compo&#383;ed, &#383;he took a new&#383;paper out of
her pocket, declaring, 'that her heart
&#383;mote her, but what could &#383;he do?&mdash;&#383;he
mu&#383;t obey her hu&#383;band.' I &#383;natched
the paper from her. An adverti&#383;ement
quickly met my eye, purporting,
that 'Maria Venables had, without
any a&#383;&#383;ignable cau&#383;e, ab&#383;conded from
her hu&#383;band; and any per&#383;on harbouring
her, was menaced with the utmo&#383;t
&#383;everity of the law.'</p>

<p>"Perfectly acquainted with Mr.
Venables' meanne&#383;s of &#383;oul, this &#383;tep
did not excite my &#383;urpri&#383;e, and &#383;carcely
my contempt. Re&#383;entment in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-82_S" id="Pg_2-82_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-82.png">82</a>]</span>
brea&#383;t, never &#383;urvived love. I bade
the poor woman, in a kind tone, wipe
her eyes, and reque&#383;t her hu&#383;band to
come up, and &#383;peak to me him&#383;elf.</p>

<p>"My manner awed him. He re&#383;pected
a lady, though not a woman;
and began to mutter out an apology.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Venables was a rich gentleman;
he wi&#383;hed to oblige me, but he
had &#383;uffered enough by the law already,
to tremble at the thought;
be&#383;ides, for certain, we &#383;hould come
together again, and then even I &#383;hould
not thank him for being acce&#383;&#383;ary to
keeping us a&#383;under.&mdash;A hu&#383;band and
wife were, God knows, ju&#383;t as one,&mdash;and
all would come round at la&#383;t.' He
uttered a drawling 'Hem!' and then
with an arch look, added&mdash;'Ma&#383;ter
might have had his little frolics&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-83_S" id="Pg_2-83_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-83.png">83</a>]</span>&mdash;Lord
ble&#383;s your heart!&mdash;men would
be men while the world &#383;tands.'</p>

<p>"To argue with this privileged fir&#383;t-born
of rea&#383;on, I perceived, would be
vain. I therefore only reque&#383;ted him to
let me remain another day at his hou&#383;e,
while I &#383;ought for a lodging; and not
to inform Mr. Venables that I had ever
been &#383;heltered there.</p>

<p>"He con&#383;ented, becau&#383;e he had not
the courage to refu&#383;e a per&#383;on for whom
he had an habitual re&#383;pect; but I heard
the pent-up choler bur&#383;t forth in cur&#383;es,
when he met his wife, who was waiting
impatiently at the foot of the &#383;tairs,
to know what effect my expo&#383;tulations
would have on him.</p>

<p>"Without wa&#383;ting any time in the
fruitle&#383;s indulgence of vexation, I once
more &#383;et out in &#383;earch of an abode in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-84_S" id="Pg_2-84_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-84.png">84</a>]</span>
which I could hide my&#383;elf for a few
weeks.</p>

<p>"Agreeing to pay an exorbitant
price, I hired an apartment, without
any reference being required relative
to my character: indeed, a glance
at my &#383;hape &#383;eemed to &#383;ay, that my
motive for concealment was &#383;ufficiently
obvious. Thus was I obliged to &#383;hroud
my head in infamy.</p>

<p>"To avoid all danger of detection&mdash;I
u&#383;e the appropriate word, my child,
for I was hunted out like a felon&mdash;I
determined to take po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of my
new lodgings that very evening.</p>

<p>"I did not inform my landlady
where I was going. I knew that &#383;he
had a &#383;incere affection for me, and
would willingly have run any ri&#383;k to
&#383;how her gratitude; yet I was fully convinced,
that a few kind words from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-85_S" id="Pg_2-85_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-85.png">85</a>]</span>
Johnny would have found the woman
in her, and her dear benefactre&#383;s, as
&#383;he termed me in an agony of tears,
would have been &#383;acrificed, to recompen&#383;e
her tyrant for conde&#383;cending to
treat her like an equal. He could be
kind-hearted, as &#383;he expre&#383;&#383;ed it, when
he plea&#383;ed. And this thawed &#383;ternne&#383;s,
contra&#383;ted with his habitual brutality,
was the more acceptable, and
could not be purcha&#383;ed at too dear a
rate.</p>

<p>"The &#383;ight of the adverti&#383;ement
made me de&#383;irous of taking refuge with
my uncle, let what would be the con&#383;equence;
and I repaired in a hackney
coach (afraid of meeting &#383;ome per&#383;on
who might chance to know me, had I
walked) to the chambers of my uncle's
friend.</p>

<p>"He received me with great polite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-86_S" id="Pg_2-86_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-86.png">86</a>]</span>ne&#383;s
(my uncle had already prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed
him in my favour), and li&#383;tened, with
intere&#383;t, to my explanation of the
motives which had induced me to fly
from home, and &#383;kulk in ob&#383;curity,
with all the timidity of fear that ought
only to be the companion of guilt. He
lamented, with rather more gallantry
than, in my &#383;ituation, I thought delicate,
that &#383;uch a woman &#383;hould be
thrown away on a man in&#383;en&#383;ible to the
charms of beauty or grace. He &#383;eemed
at a lo&#383;s what to advi&#383;e me to do, to
evade my hu&#383;band's &#383;earch, without
ha&#383;tening to my uncle, whom, he he&#383;itating
&#383;aid, I might not find alive. He
uttered this intelligence with vi&#383;ible
regret; reque&#383;ted me, at lea&#383;t, to wait
for the arrival of the next packet; offered
me what money I wanted, and
promi&#383;ed to vi&#383;it me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-87_S" id="Pg_2-87_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-87.png">87</a>]</span>
"He kept his word; &#383;till no letter
arrived to put an end to my painful
&#383;tate of &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e. I procured &#383;ome
books and mu&#383;ic, to beguile the tedious
&#383;olitary days.</p>

<p>I &#383;ung&mdash;and &#383;ung till, &#383;addened by the
&#383;train of joy, I bitterly lamented the
fate that deprived me of all &#383;ocial plea&#383;ure.

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIII_S" id="CHAP_XIII_S"></a>CHAP. XIII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">By</span> watching my only vi&#383;itor, my
uncle's friend, or by &#383;ome other means,
Mr. Venables di&#383;covered my re&#383;idence,
and came to enquire for me. The
maid-&#383;ervant a&#383;&#383;ured him there was no
&#383;uch per&#383;on in the hou&#383;e. A bu&#383;tle
en&#383;ued&mdash;I caught the alarm&mdash;li&#383;tened&mdash;di&#383;tingui&#383;hed
his voice, and immediately
locked the door. They &#383;uddenly
grew &#383;till; and I waited near a
quarter of an hour, before I heard him
open the parlour door, and mount the
&#383;tairs with the mi&#383;tre&#383;s of the hou&#383;e,
who ob&#383;equiou&#383;ly declared that &#383;he
knew nothing of me.</p>

<p>"Finding my door locked, &#383;he reque&#383;ted
me to 'open it, and prepare to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-89_S" id="Pg_2-89_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-89.png">89</a>]</span>
go home with my hu&#383;band, poor gentleman!
to whom I had already occa&#383;ioned
&#383;ufficient vexation.' I made no
reply. Mr. Venables then, in an a&#383;&#383;umed
tone of &#383;oftne&#383;s, intreated me,
'to con&#383;ider what he &#383;uffered, and my
own reputation, and get the better of
childi&#383;h re&#383;entment.' He ran on in
the &#383;ame &#383;train, pretending to addre&#383;s
me, but evidently adapting his di&#383;cour&#383;e
to the capacity of the landlady;
who, at every pau&#383;e, uttered an exclamation
of pity; or 'Yes, to be &#383;ure&mdash;Very
true, &#383;ir.'</p>

<p>"Sick of the farce, and perceiving
that I could not avoid the hated interview,
I opened the door, and he entered.
Advancing with ea&#383;y a&#383;&#383;urance
to take my hand, I &#383;hrunk from his
touch, with an involuntary &#383;tart, as I
&#383;hould have done from a noi&#383;ome reptile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-90_S" id="Pg_2-90_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-90.png">90</a>]</span>
with more di&#383;gu&#383;t than terror. His
conductre&#383;s was retiring, to give us, as
&#383;he &#383;aid, an opportunity to accommodate
matters. But I bade her come in,
or I would go out; and curio&#383;ity impelled
her to obey me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables began to expo&#383;tulate;
and this woman, proud of his
confidence, to &#383;econd him. But I
calmly &#383;ilenced her, in the mid&#383;t of a
vulgar harangue, and turning to him,
a&#383;ked, 'Why he vainly tormented me?
declaring that no power on earth
&#383;hould force me back to his hou&#383;e.'</p>

<p>"After a long altercation, the particulars
of which, it would be to no
purpo&#383;e to repeat, he left the room.
Some time was &#383;pent in loud conver&#383;ation
in the parlour below, and I
di&#383;covered that he had brought his
friend, an attorney, with him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-91_S" id="Pg_2-91_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-91.png">91</a>]</span></p>

<p>*&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The tumult on the landing
place, brought out a gentleman, who
had recently taken apartments in the
hou&#383;e; he enquired why I was thus
a&#383;&#383;ailed<a name="FNanchor_91-A_7_S" id="FNanchor_91-A_7_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_91-A_7_S" class="fnanchor">[91-A]</a>? The voluble attorney in&#383;tantly
repeated the trite tale. The
&#383;tranger turned to me, ob&#383;erving,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-92_S" id="Pg_2-92_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-92.png">92</a>]</span>
with the mo&#383;t &#383;oothing politene&#383;s and
manly intere&#383;t, that 'my countenance
told a very different &#383;tory.' He added,
'that I &#383;hould not be in&#383;ulted, or
forced out of the hou&#383;e, by any body.'</p>

<p>"'Not by her hu&#383;band?' a&#383;ked the
attorney.</p>

<p>"'No, &#383;ir, not by her hu&#383;band.' Mr.
Venables advanced towards him&mdash;But
there was a deci&#383;ion in his attitude,
that &#383;o well &#383;econded that of his voice,</p>
<p class="sp">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>*&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; They left the hou&#383;e: at

that &#383;hould dare to protect me, &#383;hould
be pro&#383;ecuted with the utmo&#383;t rigour.</p>

<p>"They were &#383;carcely out of the
hou&#383;e, when my landlady came up to
me again, and begged my pardon, in
a very different tone. For, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-93_S" id="Pg_2-93_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-93.png">93</a>]</span>
Mr. Venables had bid her, at her peril,
harbour me, he had not attended, I
found, to her broad hints, to di&#383;charge
the lodging. I in&#383;tantly promi&#383;ed to
pay her, and make her a pre&#383;ent to
compen&#383;ate for my abrupt departure,
if &#383;he would procure me another lodging,
at a &#383;ufficient di&#383;tance; and &#383;he, in
return, repeating Mr. Venables' plau&#383;ible
tale, I rai&#383;ed her indignation, and
excited her &#383;ympathy, by telling her
briefly the truth.</p>

<p>"She expre&#383;&#383;ed her commi&#383;eration
with &#383;uch hone&#383;t warmth, that I felt
&#383;oothed; for I have none of that fa&#383;tidious
&#383;en&#383;itivene&#383;s, which a vulgar accent
or ge&#383;ture can alarm to the di&#383;regard
of real kindne&#383;s. I was ever glad
to perceive in others the humane feelings
I delighted to exerci&#383;e; and the
recollection of &#383;ome ridiculous charac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-94_S" id="Pg_2-94_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-94.png">94</a>]</span>teri&#383;tic
circum&#383;tances, which have occurred
in a moment of emotion, has
convul&#383;ed me with laughter, though
at the in&#383;tant I &#383;hould have thought it
&#383;acrilegious to have &#383;miled. Your improvement,
my deare&#383;t girl, being ever
pre&#383;ent to me while I write, I note
the&#383;e feelings, becau&#383;e women, more
accu&#383;tomed to ob&#383;erve manners than
actions, are too much alive to ridicule.
So much &#383;o, that their boa&#383;ted &#383;en&#383;ibility
is often &#383;tifled by fal&#383;e delicacy.
True &#383;en&#383;ibility, the &#383;en&#383;ibility which
is the auxiliary of virtue, and the &#383;oul
of genius, is in &#383;ociety &#383;o occupied
with the feelings of others, as &#383;carcely
to regard its own &#383;en&#383;ations. With
what reverence have I looked up at my
uncle, the dear parent of my mind!
when I have &#383;een the &#383;en&#383;e of his own
&#383;ufferings, of mind and body, ab&#383;orbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-95_S" id="Pg_2-95_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-95.png">95</a>]</span>
in a de&#383;ire to comfort tho&#383;e, who&#383;e mi&#383;fortunes
were comparatively trivial.
He would have been a&#383;hamed of being
as indulgent to him&#383;elf, as he was to
others. 'Genuine fortitude,' he would
a&#383;&#383;ert, 'con&#383;i&#383;ted in governing our own
emotions, and making allowance for
the weakne&#383;&#383;es in our friends, that we
would not tolerate in our&#383;elves.' But
where is my fond regret leading me!</p>

<p>"'Women mu&#383;t be &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ive,' &#383;aid
my landlady. 'Indeed what could
mo&#383;t women do? Who had they to
maintain them, but their hu&#383;bands?
Every woman, and e&#383;pecially a lady,
could not go through rough and
&#383;mooth, as &#383;he had done, to earn a little
bread.'</p>

<p>"She was in a talking mood, and
proceeded to inform me how &#383;he had
been u&#383;ed in the world. 'She knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-96_S" id="Pg_2-96_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-96.png">96</a>]</span>
what it was to have a bad hu&#383;band, or
&#383;he did not know who &#383;hould.' I perceived
that &#383;he would be very much
mortified, were I not to attend to her
tale, and I did not attempt to interrupt
her, though I wi&#383;hed her, as &#383;oon
as po&#383;&#383;ible, to go out in &#383;earch of a new
abode for me, where I could once more
hide my head.</p>

<p>"She began by telling me, 'That
&#383;he had &#383;aved a little money in &#383;ervice;
and was over-per&#383;uaded (we mu&#383;t all
be in love once in our lives) to marry a
likely man, a footman in the family,
not worth a groat. My plan,' &#383;he continued,
'was to take a hou&#383;e, and let
out lodgings; and all went on well,
till my hu&#383;band got acquainted with
an impudent &#383;lut, who cho&#383;e to live on
other people's means&mdash;and then all
went to rack and ruin. He ran in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-97_S" id="Pg_2-97_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-97.png">97</a>]</span>
debt to buy her fine clothes, &#383;uch
clothes as I never thought of wearing
my&#383;elf, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;he
&#383;igned an execution on my very
goods, bought with the money I
worked &#383;o hard to get; and they came
and took my bed from under me, before
I heard a word of the matter.
Aye, madam, the&#383;e are mi&#383;fortunes
that you gentlefolks know nothing of,&mdash;but
&#383;orrow is &#383;orrow, let it come
which way it will.</p>

<p>"'I &#383;ought for a &#383;ervice again&mdash;very
hard, after having a hou&#383;e of my own!&mdash;but
he u&#383;ed to follow me, and kick up
&#383;uch a riot when he was drunk, that I
could not keep a place; nay, he even
&#383;tole my clothes, and pawned them;
and when I went to the pawnbroker's,
and offered to take my oath that they
were not bought with a farthing of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-98_S" id="Pg_2-98_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-98.png">98</a>]</span>
money, they &#383;aid, 'It was all as one,
my hu&#383;band had a right to whatever I
had.'</p>

<p>"'At la&#383;t he li&#383;ted for a &#383;oldier, and
I took a hou&#383;e, making an agreement
to pay for the furniture by degrees;
and I almo&#383;t &#383;tarved my&#383;elf, till I once
more got before-hand in the world.</p>

<p>"'After an ab&#383;ence of &#383;ix years
(God forgive me! I thought he was
dead) my hu&#383;band returned; found me
out, and came with &#383;uch a penitent
face, I forgave him, and clothed him
from head to foot. But he had not
been a week in the hou&#383;e, before &#383;ome
of his creditors arre&#383;ted him; and, he
&#383;elling my goods, I found my&#383;elf once
more reduced to beggary; for I was
not as well able to work, go to bed
late, and ri&#383;e early, as when I quitted
&#383;ervice; and then I thought it hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-99_S" id="Pg_2-99_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-99.png">99</a>]</span>
enough. He was &#383;oon tired of me,
when there was nothing more to be
had, and left me again.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins>I will not tell you how I was buffeted
about, till, hearing for certain
that he had died in an ho&#383;pital abroad,
I once more returned to my old occupation;
but have not yet been able to
get my head above water: &#383;o, madam,
you mu&#383;t not be angry if I am afraid to
run any ri&#383;k, when I know &#383;o well,
that women have always the wor&#383;t of
it, when law is to decide.'</p>

<p>"After uttering a few more complaints,
I prevailed on my landlady to
go out in que&#383;t of a lodging; and, to
be more &#383;ecure, I conde&#383;cended to the
mean &#383;hift of changing my name.</p>

<p>"But why &#383;hould I dwell on &#383;imilar
incidents!&mdash;I was hunted, like an infected
bea&#383;t, from three different apartments,
and &#383;hould not have been al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-100_S" id="Pg_2-100_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-100.png">100</a>]</span>lowed
to re&#383;t in any, had not Mr. Venables,
informed of my uncle's dangerous
&#383;tate of health, been in&#383;pired with
the fear of hurrying me out of the
world as I advanced in my pregnancy,
by thus tormenting and obliging me to
take &#383;udden journeys to avoid him; and
then his &#383;peculations on my uncle's fortune
mu&#383;t prove abortive.</p>

<p>"One day, when he had pur&#383;ued me
to an inn, I fainted, hurrying from him;
and, falling down, the &#383;ight of my blood
alarmed him, and obtained a re&#383;pite for
me. It is &#383;trange that he &#383;hould have
retained any hope, after ob&#383;erving my
unwavering determination; but, from
the mildne&#383;s of my behaviour, when I
found all my endeavours to change his
di&#383;po&#383;ition unavailing, he formed an
erroneous opinion of my character, imagining
that, were we once more together,
I &#383;hould part with the money he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-101_S" id="Pg_2-101_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-101.png">101</a>]</span>
could not legally force from me, with
the &#383;ame facility as formerly. My forbearance
and occa&#383;ional &#383;ympathy he
had mi&#383;taken for weakne&#383;s of character;
and, becau&#383;e he perceived that I
di&#383;liked re&#383;i&#383;tance, he thought my indulgence
and compa&#383;&#383;ion mere &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s,
and never di&#383;covered that the fear of
being unju&#383;t, or of unnece&#383;&#383;arily wounding
the feelings of another, was much
more painful to me, than any thing I
could have to endure my&#383;elf. Perhaps
it was pride which made me imagine,
that I could bear what I dreaded to inflict;
and that it was often ea&#383;ier to &#383;uffer,
than to &#383;ee the &#383;ufferings of others.</p>

<p>"I forgot to mention that, during
this per&#383;ecution, I received a letter
from my uncle, informing me, 'that
he only found relief from continual
change of air; and that he intended to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-102_S" id="Pg_2-102_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-102.png">102</a>]</span>
return when the &#383;pring was a little more
advanced (it was now the middle of
February), and then we would plan a
journey to Italy, leaving the fogs and
cares of England far behind.' He approved
of my conduct, promi&#383;ed to
adopt my child, and &#383;eemed to have
no doubt of obliging Mr. Venables to
hear rea&#383;on. He wrote to his friend,
by the &#383;ame po&#383;t, de&#383;iring him to call
on Mr. Venables in his name; and, in
con&#383;equence of the remon&#383;trances he
dictated, I was permitted to lie-in tranquilly.</p>

<p>"The two or three weeks previous, I
had been allowed to re&#383;t in peace; but,
&#383;o accu&#383;tomed was I to pur&#383;uit and
alarm, that I &#383;eldom clo&#383;ed my eyes
without being haunted by Mr. Venables'
image, who &#383;eemed to a&#383;&#383;ume terrific or
hateful forms to torment me, wherever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-103_S" id="Pg_2-103_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-103.png">103</a>]</span>
I turned.&mdash;Sometimes a wild cat, a
roaring bull, or hideous a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in, whom
I vainly attempted to fly; at others he
was a demon, hurrying me to the brink
of a precipice, plunging me into dark
waves, or horrid gulfs; and I woke,
in violent fits of trembling anxiety, to
a&#383;&#383;ure my&#383;elf that it was all a dream,
and to endeavour to lure my waking
thoughts to wander to the delightful
Italian vales, I hoped &#383;oon to vi&#383;it; or
to picture &#383;ome augu&#383;t ruins, where I
reclined in fancy on a mouldering column,
and e&#383;caped, in the contemplation
of the heart-enlarging virtues of antiquity,
from the turmoil of cares that
had depre&#383;&#383;ed all the daring purpo&#383;es
of my &#383;oul. But I was not long allowed
to calm my mind by the exerci&#383;e
of my imagination; for the third
day after your birth, my child, I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-104_S" id="Pg_2-104_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-104.png">104</a>]</span>
&#383;urpri&#383;ed by a vi&#383;it from my elder brother;
who came in the mo&#383;t abrupt
manner, to inform me of the death of
my uncle. He had left the greater
part of his fortune to my child, appointing
me its guardian; in &#383;hort,
every &#383;tep was taken to enable me to
be mi&#383;tre&#383;s of his fortune, without putting
any part of it in Mr. Venables'
power. My brother came to vent his
rage on me, for having, as he expre&#383;&#383;ed
him&#383;elf, 'deprived him, my uncle's
elde&#383;t nephew, of his inheritance;'
though my uncle's property, the fruit
of his own exertion, being all in the
funds, or on landed &#383;ecurities, there
was not a &#383;hadow of ju&#383;tice in the
charge.</p>

<p>"As I &#383;incerely loved my uncle, this
intelligence brought on a fever, which
I &#383;truggled to conquer with all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-105_S" id="Pg_2-105_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-105.png">105</a>]</span>
energy of my mind; for, in my de&#383;olate
&#383;tate, I had it very much at heart to
&#383;uckle you, my poor babe. You
&#383;eemed my only tie to life, a cherub,
to whom I wi&#383;hed to be a father, as
well as a mother; and the double duty
appeared to me to produce a proportionate
increa&#383;e of affection. But the
plea&#383;ure I felt, while &#383;u&#383;taining you,
&#383;natched from the wreck of hope, was
cruelly damped by melancholy reflections
on my widowed &#383;tate&mdash;widowed
by the death of my uncle. Of Mr.
Venables I thought not, even when I
thought of the felicity of loving your
father, and how a mother's plea&#383;ure
might be exalted, and her care &#383;oftened
by a hu&#383;band's tenderne&#383;s.&mdash;'Ought to
be!' I exclaimed; and I endeavoured
to drive away the tenderne&#383;s that &#383;uffo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-106_S" id="Pg_2-106_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-106.png">106</a>]</span>cated
me; but my &#383;pirits were weak,
and the unbidden tears would flow.
'Why was I,' I would a&#383;k thee, but
thou did&#383;t not heed me,&mdash;'cut off from
the participation of the &#383;weete&#383;t plea&#383;ure
of life?' I imagined with what
extacy, after the pains of child-bed, I
&#383;hould have pre&#383;ented my little &#383;tranger,
whom I had &#383;o long wi&#383;hed to view, to
a re&#383;pectable father, and with what
maternal fondne&#383;s I &#383;hould have pre&#383;&#383;ed
them both to my heart!&mdash;Now I ki&#383;&#383;ed
her with le&#383;s delight, though with the
mo&#383;t endearing compa&#383;&#383;ion, poor helple&#383;s
one! when I perceived a &#383;light re&#383;emblance
of him, to whom &#383;he owed
her exi&#383;tence; or, if any ge&#383;ture reminded
me of him, even in his be&#383;t
days, my heart heaved, and I pre&#383;&#383;ed
the innocent to my bo&#383;om, as if to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-107_S" id="Pg_2-107_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-107.png">107</a>]</span>
purify it&mdash;yes, I blu&#383;hed to think that
its purity had been &#383;ullied, by allowing
&#383;uch a man to be its father.</p>

<p>"After my recovery, I began to
think of taking a hou&#383;e in the country,
or of making an excur&#383;ion on the continent,
to avoid Mr. Venables; and to
open my heart to new plea&#383;ures and
affection. The &#383;pring was melting into
&#383;ummer, and you, my little companion,
began to &#383;mile&mdash;that &#383;mile
made hope bud out afre&#383;h, a&#383;&#383;uring me
the world was not a de&#383;ert. Your
ge&#383;tures were ever pre&#383;ent to my
fancy; and I dwelt on the joy I &#383;hould
feel when you would begin to walk and
li&#383;p. Watching your wakening mind,
and &#383;hielding from every rude bla&#383;t
my tender blo&#383;&#383;om, I recovered my
&#383;pirits&mdash;I dreamed not of the fro&#383;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-108_S" id="Pg_2-108_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-108.png">108</a>]</span>&mdash;'the
killing fro&#383;t,' to which you were
de&#383;tined to be expo&#383;ed.&mdash;But I lo&#383;e all
patience&mdash;and execrate the inju&#383;tice
of the world&mdash;folly! ignorance!&mdash;I
&#383;hould rather call it; but, &#383;hut up from
a free circulation of thought, and always
pondering on the &#383;ame griefs, I
writhe under the torturing apprehen&#383;ions,
which ought to excite only
hone&#383;t indignation, or active compa&#383;&#383;ion;
and would, could I view them
as the natural con&#383;equence of things.
But, born a woman&mdash;and born to &#383;uffer,
in endeavouring to repre&#383;s my own
emotions, I feel more acutely the various
ills my &#383;ex are fated to bear&mdash;I
feel that the evils they are &#383;ubject to
endure, degrade them &#383;o far below
their oppre&#383;&#383;ors, as almo&#383;t to ju&#383;tify
their tyranny; leading at the &#383;ame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-109_S" id="Pg_2-109_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-109.png">109</a>]</span>
time &#383;uperficial rea&#383;oners to term that
weakne&#383;s the cau&#383;e, which is only
the con&#383;equence of &#383;hort-&#383;ighted de&#383;poti&#383;m.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIV_S" id="CHAP_XIV_S"></a>CHAP. XIV.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">As</span> my mind grew calmer, the
vi&#383;ions of Italy again returned with
their former glow of colouring; and I
re&#383;olved on quitting the kingdom for
a time, in &#383;earch of the cheerfulne&#383;s,
that naturally re&#383;ults from a change of
&#383;cene, unle&#383;s we carry the barbed arrow
with us, and only &#383;ee what we
feel.</p>

<p>"During the period nece&#383;&#383;ary to
prepare for a long ab&#383;ence, I &#383;ent a
&#383;upply to pay my father's debts, and
&#383;ettled my brothers in eligible &#383;ituations;
but my attention was not
wholly engro&#383;&#383;ed by my family, though
I do not think it nece&#383;&#383;ary to enumerate
the common exertions of huma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-111_S" id="Pg_2-111_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-111.png">111</a>]</span>nity.
The manner in which my uncle's
property was &#383;ettled, prevented
me from making the addition to the
fortune of my &#383;urviving &#383;i&#383;ter, that I
could have wi&#383;hed; but I had prevailed
on him to bequeath her two
thou&#383;and pounds, and &#383;he determined
to marry a lover, to whom &#383;he had
been &#383;ome time attached. Had it not
been for this engagement, I &#383;hould have
invited her to accompany me in my
tour; and I might have e&#383;caped the
pit, &#383;o artfully dug in my path, when
I was the lea&#383;t aware of danger.</p>

<p>"I had thought of remaining in
England, till I weaned my child; but
this &#383;tate of freedom was too peaceful
to la&#383;t, and I had &#383;oon rea&#383;on to wi&#383;h
to ha&#383;ten my departure. A friend of
Mr. Venables, the &#383;ame attorney who
had accompanied him in &#383;everal excur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-112_S" id="Pg_2-112_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-112.png">112</a>]</span>&#383;ions
to hunt me from my hiding places,
waited on me to propo&#383;e a reconciliation.
On my refu&#383;al, he indirectly
advi&#383;ed me to make over to my hu&#383;band&mdash;for
hu&#383;band he would term
him&mdash;the greater part of the property
I had at command, menacing me with
continual per&#383;ecution unle&#383;s I complied,
and that, as a la&#383;t re&#383;ort, he
would claim the child. I did not,
though intimidated by the la&#383;t in&#383;inuation,
&#383;cruple to declare, that I would
not allow him to &#383;quander the money
left to me for far different purpo&#383;es,
but offered him five hundred pounds, if
he would &#383;ign a bond not to torment
me any more. My maternal anxiety
made me thus appear to waver from
my fir&#383;t determination, and probably
&#383;ugge&#383;ted to him, or his diabolical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-113_S" id="Pg_2-113_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-113.png">113</a>]</span>
agent, the infernal plot, which has
&#383;ucceeded but too well.</p>

<p>"The bond was executed; &#383;till I
was impatient to leave England. Mi&#383;chief
hung in the air when we breathed
the &#383;ame; I wanted &#383;eas to divide
us, and waters to roll between, till he
had forgotten that I had the means of
helping him through a new &#383;cheme.
Di&#383;turbed by the late occurrences, I in&#383;tantly
prepared for my departure.
My only delay was waiting for a maid-&#383;ervant,
who &#383;poke French fluently,
and had been warmly recommended to
me. A valet I was advi&#383;ed to hire,
when I fixed on my place of re&#383;idence
for any time.</p>

<p>"My God, with what a light heart
did I &#383;et out for Dover!&mdash;It was not my
country, but my cares, that I was leaving
behind. My heart &#383;eemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-114_S" id="Pg_2-114_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-114.png">114</a>]</span>
bound with the wheels, or rather appeared
the centre on which they twirled.
I cla&#383;ped you to my bo&#383;om, exclaiming
'And you will be &#383;afe&mdash;quite
&#383;afe&mdash;when&mdash;we are once on
board the packet.&mdash;Would we were
there!' I &#383;miled at my idle fears, as
the natural effect of continual alarm;
and I &#383;carcely owned to my&#383;elf that I
dreaded Mr. Venables's cunning, or
was con&#383;cious of the horrid delight he
would feel, at forming &#383;tratagem after
&#383;tratagem to circumvent me. I was
already in the &#383;nare&mdash;I never reached
the packet&mdash;I never &#383;aw thee more.&mdash;I
grow breathle&#383;s. I have &#383;carcely patience
to write down the details. The
maid&mdash;the plau&#383;ible woman I had
hired&mdash;put, doubtle&#383;s, &#383;ome &#383;tupifying
potion in what I ate or drank, the
morning I left town. All I know is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-115_S" id="Pg_2-115_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-115.png">115</a>]</span>
that &#383;he mu&#383;t have quitted the chai&#383;e,
&#383;hamele&#383;s wretch! and taken (from
my brea&#383;t) my babe with her. How
could a creature in a female form &#383;ee
me care&#383;s thee, and &#383;teal thee from my
arms! I mu&#383;t &#383;top, &#383;top to repre&#383;s a
mother's angui&#383;h; left, in bitterne&#383;s of
&#383;oul, I imprecate the wrath of heaven
on this tiger, who tore my only comfort
from me.</p>

<p>"How long I &#383;lept I know not;
certainly many hours, for I woke at the
clo&#383;e of day, in a &#383;trange confu&#383;ion of
thought. I was probably rou&#383;ed to recollection
by &#383;ome one thundering at a
huge, unwieldy gate. Attempting to
a&#383;k where I was, my voice died away,
and I tried to rai&#383;e it in vain, as I have
done in a dream. I looked for my babe
with affright; feared that it had fallen
out of my lap, while I had &#383;o &#383;trange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-116_S" id="Pg_2-116_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-116.png">116</a>]</span>ly
forgotten her; and, &#383;uch was the
vague intoxication, I can give it no
other name, in which I was plunged,
I could not recollect when or where I
la&#383;t &#383;aw you; but I &#383;ighed, as if my
heart wanted room to clear my head.</p>

<p>"The gates opened heavily, and
the &#383;ullen &#383;ound of many locks
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and and'">and</ins> bolts drawn back, grated on
my very &#383;oul, before I was appalled by
the creeking of the di&#383;mal hinges, as
they clo&#383;ed after me. The gloomy
pile was before me, half in ruins; &#383;ome
of the aged trees of the avenue were
cut down, and left to rot where they
fell; and as we approached &#383;ome
mouldering &#383;teps, a mon&#383;trous dog
darted forwards to the length of his
chain, and barked and growled infernally.</p>

<p>"The door was opened &#383;lowly, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-117_S" id="Pg_2-117_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-117.png">117</a>]</span>
a murderous vi&#383;age peeped out, with a
lantern. 'Hu&#383;h!' he uttered, in a
threatning tone, and the affrighted
animal &#383;tole back to his kennel. The
door of the chai&#383;e flew back, the
&#383;tranger put down the lantern, and
cla&#383;ped his dreadful arms around me.
It was certainly the effect of the &#383;oporific
draught, for, in&#383;tead of exerting
my &#383;trength, I &#383;unk without motion,
though not without &#383;en&#383;e, on his &#383;houlder,
my limbs refu&#383;ing to obey my
will. I was carried up the &#383;teps into a
clo&#383;e-&#383;hut hall. A candle flaring in
the &#383;ocket, &#383;carcely di&#383;per&#383;ed the darkne&#383;s,
though it di&#383;played to me the
ferocious countenance of the wretch
who held me.</p>

<p>"He mounted a wide &#383;tairca&#383;e.
Large figures painted on the walls
&#383;eemed to &#383;tart on me, and glaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-118_S" id="Pg_2-118_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-118.png">118</a>]</span>
eyes to meet me at every turn. Entering
a long gallery, a di&#383;mal &#383;hriek made
me &#383;pring out of my conductor's arms,
with I know not what my&#383;terious emotion
of terror; but I fell on the floor,
unable to &#383;u&#383;tain my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>"A &#383;trange-looking female &#383;tarted
out of one of the rece&#383;&#383;es, and ob&#383;erved
me with more curio&#383;ity than intere&#383;t;
till, &#383;ternly bid retire, &#383;he flitted back
like a &#383;hadow. Other faces, &#383;trongly
marked, or di&#383;torted, peeped through
the half-opened doors, and I heard
&#383;ome incoherent &#383;ounds. I had no
di&#383;tinct idea where I could be&mdash;I looked
on all &#383;ides, and almo&#383;t doubted whether
I was alive or dead.</p>

<p>"Thrown on a bed, I immediately
&#383;unk into in&#383;en&#383;ibility again; and next
day, gradually recovering the u&#383;e of
rea&#383;on, I began, &#383;tarting affrighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-119_S" id="Pg_2-119_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-119.png">119</a>]</span>
from the conviction, to di&#383;cover where
I was confined&mdash;I in&#383;i&#383;ted on &#383;eeing the
ma&#383;ter of the man&#383;ion&mdash;I &#383;aw him&mdash;and
perceived that I was buried alive.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such, my child, are the events of
thy mother's life to this dreadful moment&mdash;Should
&#383;he ever e&#383;cape from
the fangs of her enemies, &#383;he will add
the &#383;ecrets of her pri&#383;on-hou&#383;e&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Some lines were here cro&#383;&#383;ed out,
and the memoirs broke off abruptly
with the names of Jemima and Darnford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darnford</span> returned the memoirs
to Maria, with a mo&#383;t affectionate
letter, in which he rea&#383;oned on "the
ab&#383;urdity of the laws re&#383;pecting matrimony,
which, till divorces could be
more ea&#383;ily obtained, was," he declared,
"the mo&#383;t in&#383;ufferable bondage. Ties of
this nature could not bind minds governed
by &#383;uperior principles; and &#383;uch
beings were privileged to act above the
dictates of laws they had no voice in
framing, if they had &#383;ufficient &#383;trength
of mind to endure the natural con&#383;equence.
In her ca&#383;e, to talk of duty,
was a farce, excepting what was due
to her&#383;elf. Delicacy, as well as rea&#383;on,
forbade her ever to think of returning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-124_S" id="Pg_2-124_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-124.png">124</a>]</span>
to her hu&#383;band: was &#383;he then to re&#383;train
her charming &#383;en&#383;ibility through
mere prejudice? The&#383;e arguments
were not ab&#383;olutely impartial, for he
di&#383;dained to conceal, that, when he
appealed to her rea&#383;on, he felt that
he had &#383;ome intere&#383;t in her heart.&mdash;The
conviction was not more tran&#383;porting,
than &#383;acred&mdash;a thou&#383;and times a
day, he a&#383;ked him&#383;elf how he had merited
&#383;uch happine&#383;s?&mdash;and as often he
determined to purify the heart &#383;he
deigned to inhabit&mdash;He intreated to be
again admitted to her pre&#383;ence."</p>

<p>He was; and the tear which gli&#383;tened
in his eye, when he re&#383;pectfully
pre&#383;&#383;ed her to his bo&#383;om, rendered him
peculiarly dear to the unfortunate mother.
Grief had &#383;tilled the tran&#383;ports
of love, only to render their mutual
tenderne&#383;s more touching. In former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-125_S" id="Pg_2-125_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-125.png">125</a>]</span>
interviews, Darnford had contrived, by
a hundred little pretexts, to &#383;it near
her, to take her hand, or to meet her
eyes&mdash;now it was all &#383;oothing affection,
and e&#383;teem &#383;eemed to have rivalled
love. He adverted to her narrative,
and &#383;poke with warmth of the oppre&#383;&#383;ion
&#383;he had endured.&mdash;His eyes, glowing
with a lambent flame, told her
how much he wi&#383;hed to re&#383;tore her to
liberty and love; but he ki&#383;&#383;ed her
hand, as if it had been that of a &#383;aint;
and &#383;poke of the lo&#383;s of her child, as if it
had been his own.&mdash;What could have
been more flattering to Maria?&mdash;Every
in&#383;tance of &#383;elf-denial was regi&#383;tered in
her heart, and &#383;he loved him, for loving
her too well to give way to the
tran&#383;ports of pa&#383;&#383;ion.</p>

<p>They met again and again; and
Darnford declared, while pa&#383;&#383;ion &#383;uf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-126_S" id="Pg_2-126_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-126.png">126</a>]</span>fu&#383;ed
his cheeks, that he never before
knew what it was to love.&mdash;</p>

<p>One morning Jemima informed
Maria, that her ma&#383;ter intended to
wait on her, and &#383;peak to her without
witne&#383;&#383;es. He came, and brought a
letter with him, pretending that he
was ignorant of its contents, though he
in&#383;i&#383;ted on having it returned to him.
It was from the attorney already mentioned,
who informed her of the death
of her child, and hinted, "that &#383;he
could not now have a legitimate heir,
and that, would &#383;he make over the
half of her fortune during life, &#383;he
&#383;hould be conveyed to Dover, and permitted
to pur&#383;ue her plan of travelling."</p>

<p>Maria an&#383;wered with warmth,
"That &#383;he had no terms to make with
the murderer of her babe, nor would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-127_S" id="Pg_2-127_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-127.png">127</a>]</span>
&#383;he purcha&#383;e liberty at the price of her
own re&#383;pect."</p>

<p>She began to expo&#383;tulate with her
jailor; but he &#383;ternly bade her "Be
&#383;ilent&mdash;he had not gone &#383;o far, not to
go further."</p>

<p>Darnford came in the evening.
Jemima was obliged to be ab&#383;ent, and
&#383;he, as u&#383;ual, locked the door on them,
to prevent interruption or di&#383;covery.&mdash;The
lovers were, at fir&#383;t, embarra&#383;&#383;ed;
but fell in&#383;en&#383;ibly into confidential di&#383;cour&#383;e.
Darnford repre&#383;ented, "that
they might &#383;oon be parted," and wi&#383;hed
her "to put it out of the power of fate
to &#383;eparate them."</p>

<p>As her hu&#383;band &#383;he now received him,
and he &#383;olemnly pledged him&#383;elf as her
protector&mdash;and eternal friend.&mdash;</p>

<p>There was one peculiarity in Maria's
mind: &#383;he was more anxious not
to deceive, than to guard again&#383;t de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-128_S" id="Pg_2-128_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-128.png">128</a>]</span>ception;
and had rather tru&#383;t without
&#383;ufficient rea&#383;on, than be for ever the
prey of doubt. Be&#383;ides, what are we,
when the mind has, from reflection, a
certain kind of elevation, which exalts
the contemplation above the little concerns
of prudence! We &#383;ee what we
wi&#383;h, and make a world of our own&mdash;and,
though reality may &#383;ometimes open
a door to mi&#383;ery, yet the moments of
happine&#383;s procured by the imagination,
may, without a paradox, be reckoned
among the &#383;olid comforts of life. Maria
now, imagining that &#383;he had found
a being of cele&#383;tial mould&mdash;was happy,&mdash;nor
was &#383;he deceived.&mdash;He was then
pla&#383;tic in her impa&#383;&#383;ioned hand&mdash;and
reflected all the &#383;entiments which animated
and warmed her.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XVI_S" id="CHAP_XVI_S"></a>CHAP. XVI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning confu&#383;ion &#383;eemed to
reign in the hou&#383;e, and Jemima came
in terror, to inform Maria, "that her
ma&#383;ter had left it, with a determination,
&#383;he was a&#383;&#383;ured (and too many
circum&#383;tances corroborated the opinion,
to leave a doubt of its truth) of never
returning. I am prepared then,"
&#383;aid Jemima, "to accompany you in
your flight."</p>

<p>Maria &#383;tarted up, her eyes darting
towards the door, as if afraid that &#383;ome
one &#383;hould fa&#383;ten it on her for ever.</p>

<p>Jemima continued, "I have perhaps
no right now to expect the performance
of your promi&#383;e; but on you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-130_S" id="Pg_2-130_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-130.png">130</a>]</span>
it depends to reconcile me with the
human race."</p>

<p>"But Darnford!"&mdash;exclaimed Maria,
mournfully&mdash;&#383;itting down again,
and cro&#383;&#383;ing her arms&mdash;"I have no
child to go to, and liberty has lo&#383;t its
&#383;weets."</p>

<p>"I am much mi&#383;taken, if Darnford
is not the cau&#383;e of my ma&#383;ter's flight&mdash;his
keepers a&#383;&#383;ure me, that they have
promi&#383;ed to confine him two days
longer, and then he will be free&mdash;you
cannot &#383;ee him; but they will give a
letter to him the moment he is free.&mdash;In
that inform him where he may find
you in London; fix on &#383;ome hotel.
Give me your clothes; I will &#383;end them
out of the hou&#383;e with mine, and we
will &#383;lip out at the garden-gate. Write
your letter while I make the&#383;e arrangements,
but lo&#383;e no time!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-131_S" id="Pg_2-131_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-131.png">131</a>]</span>
In an agitation of &#383;pirit, not to be
calmed, Maria began to write to Darnford.
She called him by the &#383;acred
name of "hu&#383;band," and bade him "ha&#383;ten
to her, to &#383;hare her fortune, or &#383;he
would return to him."&mdash;An hotel in the
Adelphi was the place of rendezvous.</p>

<p>The letter was &#383;ealed and given in
charge; and with light foot&#383;teps, yet
terrified at the &#383;ound of them, &#383;he de&#383;cended,
&#383;carcely breathing, and with
an indi&#383;tinct fear that &#383;he &#383;hould never
get out at the garden gate. Jemima
went fir&#383;t.</p>

<p>A being, with a vi&#383;age that would
have &#383;uited one po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed by a devil,
cro&#383;&#383;ed the path, and &#383;eized Maria by
the arm. Maria had no fear but of being
detained&mdash;"Who are you? what
are you?" for the form was &#383;carcely human.
"If you are made of fle&#383;h and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-132_S" id="Pg_2-132_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-132.png">132</a>]</span>
blood," his gha&#383;tly eyes glared on her,
"do not &#383;top me!"</p>

<p>"Woman," interrupted a &#383;epulchral
voice, "what have I to do with thee?"&mdash;Still
he gra&#383;ped her hand, muttering
a cur&#383;e.</p>

<p>"No, no; you have nothing to do
with me," &#383;he exclaimed, "this is a
moment of life and death!"&mdash;</p>

<p>With &#383;upernatural force &#383;he broke
from him, and, throwing her arms
round Jemima, cried, "Save me!" The
being, from who&#383;e gra&#383;p &#383;he had loo&#383;ed
her&#383;elf, took up a &#383;tone as they opened
the door, and with a kind of helli&#383;h
&#383;port threw it after them. They were
out of his reach.</p>

<p>When Maria arrived in town, &#383;he
drove to the hotel already fixed on. But
&#383;he could not &#383;it &#383;till&mdash;her child was ever
before her; and all that had pa&#383;&#383;ed dur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-133_S" id="Pg_2-133_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-133.png">133</a>]</span>ing
her confinement, appeared to be a
dream. She went to the hou&#383;e in the
&#383;uburbs, where, as &#383;he now di&#383;covered,
her babe had been &#383;ent. The moment
&#383;he entered, her heart grew &#383;ick; but
&#383;he wondered not that it had proved its
grave. She made the nece&#383;&#383;ary enquiries,
and the church-yard was pointed
out, in which it re&#383;ted under a turf. A
little frock which the nur&#383;e's child
wore (Maria had made it her&#383;elf)
caught her eye. The nur&#383;e was glad
to &#383;ell it for half-a-guinea, and Maria
ha&#383;tened away with the relic, and, re-entering
the hackney-coach which
waited for her, gazed on it, till &#383;he
reached her hotel.</p>

<p>She then waited on the attorney
who had made her uncle's will, and explained
to him her &#383;ituation. He readily
advanced her &#383;ome of the money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-134_S" id="Pg_2-134_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-134.png">134</a>]</span>
which &#383;till remained in his hands, and
promi&#383;ed to take the whole of the ca&#383;e
into con&#383;ideration. Maria only wi&#383;hed
to be permitted to remain in quiet&mdash;She
found that &#383;everal bills, apparently
with her &#383;ignature, had been pre&#383;ented
to her agent, nor was &#383;he for a moment
at a lo&#383;s to gue&#383;s by whom they had
been forged; yet, equally aver&#383;e to
threaten or intreat, &#383;he reque&#383;ted her
friend [the &#383;olicitor] to call on Mr. Venables.
He was not to be found at
home; but at length his agent, the attorney,
offered a conditional promi&#383;e to
Maria, to leave her in peace, as long as
&#383;he behaved with propriety, if &#383;he
would give up the notes. Maria incon&#383;iderately
con&#383;ented&mdash;Darnford was
arrived, and &#383;he wi&#383;hed to be only alive
to love; &#383;he wi&#383;hed to forget the angui&#383;h
&#383;he felt whenever &#383;he thought of
her child.</p>

They took a ready furni&#383;hed lodging
together, for &#383;he was above di&#383;gui&#383;e;
Jemima in&#383;i&#383;ting on being con&#383;idered
as her hou&#383;e-keeper, and to receive
the cu&#383;tomary &#383;tipend. On no
other terms would &#383;he remain with her
friend.</p>

<p>Darnford was indefatigable in tracing
the my&#383;terious circum&#383;tances of
his confinement. The cau&#383;e was &#383;imply,
that a relation, a very di&#383;tant one,
to whom he was heir, had died inte&#383;tate,
leaving a con&#383;iderable fortune.
On the news of Darnford's arrival [in
England, a per&#383;on, intru&#383;ted with the
management of the property, and who
had the writings in his po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion, determining,
by one bold &#383;troke, to &#383;trip
Darnford of the &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ion,] had planned
his confinement; and [as &#383;oon
as he had taken the mea&#383;ures he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-136_S" id="Pg_2-136_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-136.png">136</a>]</span>
judged mo&#383;t conducive to his object,
this ruffian, together with his in&#383;trument,]
the keeper of the private mad-hou&#383;e,
left the kingdom. Darnford,
who &#383;till pur&#383;ued his enquiries, at la&#383;t
di&#383;covered that they had fixed their
place of refuge at Paris.</p>

<p>Maria and he determined therefore,
with the faithful Jemima, to vi&#383;it
that metropolis, and accordingly were
preparing for the journey, when they
were informed that Mr. Venables had
commenced an action again&#383;t Darnford
for &#383;eduction and adultery. The indignation
Maria felt cannot be explained;
&#383;he repented of the forbearance &#383;he had
exerci&#383;ed in giving up the notes. Darnford
could not put off his journey, without
ri&#383;king the lo&#383;s of his property:
Maria therefore furni&#383;hed him with money
for his expedition; and determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-137_S" id="Pg_2-137_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-137.png">137</a>]</span>
to remain in London till the termination
of this affair.</p>

<p>She vi&#383;ited &#383;ome ladies with whom
&#383;he had formerly been intimate, but
was refu&#383;ed admittance; and at the
opera, or Ranelagh, they could not recollect
her. Among the&#383;e ladies there
were &#383;ome, not her mo&#383;t intimate acquaintance,
who were generally &#383;uppo&#383;ed
to avail them&#383;elves of the cloke
of marriage, to conceal a mode of conduct,
that would for ever have damned
their fame, had they been innocent, &#383;educed
girls. The&#383;e particularly &#383;tood
aloof.&mdash;Had &#383;he remained with her hu&#383;band,
practi&#383;ing in&#383;incerity, and neglecting
her child to manage an intrigue,
&#383;he would &#383;till have been vi&#383;ited
and re&#383;pected. If, in&#383;tead of
openly living with her lover, &#383;he could
have conde&#383;cended to call into play a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-138_S" id="Pg_2-138_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-138.png">138</a>]</span>
thou&#383;and arts, which, degrading her
own mind, might have allowed the
people who were not deceived, to pretend
to be &#383;o, &#383;he would have been
care&#383;&#383;ed and treated like an honourable
woman. "And Brutus<a name="FNanchor_138-A_8_S" id="FNanchor_138-A_8_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_138-A_8_S" class="fnanchor">[138-A]</a> is an honourable
man!" &#383;aid Mark-Antony with
equal &#383;incerity.</p>

<p>With Darnford &#383;he did not ta&#383;te uninterrupted
felicity; there was a volatility
in his manner which often di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed
her; but love gladdened the
&#383;cene; be&#383;ides, he was the mo&#383;t tender,
&#383;ympathizing creature in the world.
A fondne&#383;s for the &#383;ex often gives an
appearance of humanity to the behaviour
of men, who have &#383;mall preten&#383;ions
to the reality; and they &#383;eem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-139_S" id="Pg_2-139_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-139.png">139</a>]</span>
love others, when they are only pur&#383;uing
their own gratification. Darnford
appeared ever willing to avail him&#383;elf
of her ta&#383;te and acquirements, while
&#383;he endeavoured to profit by his deci&#383;ion
of character, and to eradicate &#383;ome
of the romantic notions, which had
taken root in her mind, while in adver&#383;ity
&#383;he had brooded over vi&#383;ions of
unattainable bli&#383;s.</p>

<p>The real affections of life, when
they are allowed to bur&#383;t forth, are buds
pregnant with joy and all the &#383;weet
emotions of the &#383;oul; yet they branch
out with wild ea&#383;e, unlike the artificial
forms of felicity, &#383;ketched by an imagination
painful alive. The &#383;ub&#383;tantial
happine&#383;s, which enlarges and civilizes
the mind, may be compared to
the plea&#383;ure experienced in roving
through nature at large, inhaling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-140_S" id="Pg_2-140_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-140.png">140</a>]</span>
&#383;weet gale natural to the clime; while
the reveries of a feveri&#383;h imagination
continually &#383;port them&#383;elves in gardens
full of aromatic &#383;hrubs, which cloy
while they delight, and weaken the
&#383;en&#383;e of plea&#383;ure they gratify. The heaven
of fancy, below or beyond the &#383;tars,
in this life, or in tho&#383;e ever-&#383;miling regions
&#383;urrounded by the unmarked
ocean of futurity, have an in&#383;ipid uniformity
which palls. Poets have imagined
&#383;cenes of bli&#383;s; but, fencing out
&#383;orrow, all the extatic emotions of the
&#383;oul, and even its grandeur, &#383;eem to
be equally excluded. We do&#383;e over
the unruffled lake, and long to &#383;cale
the rocks which fence the happy valley
of contentment, though &#383;erpents hi&#383;s
in the pathle&#383;s de&#383;ert, and danger lurks
in the unexplored wiles. Maria found
her&#383;elf more indulgent as &#383;he was hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-141_S" id="Pg_2-141_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-141.png">141</a>]</span>pier,
and di&#383;covered virtues, in characters
&#383;he had before di&#383;regarded, while
cha&#383;ing the phantoms of elegance and
excellence, which &#383;ported in the meteors
that exhale in the mar&#383;hes of mi&#383;fortune.
The heart is often &#383;hut by
romance again&#383;t &#383;ocial plea&#383;ure; and,
fo&#383;tering a &#383;ickly &#383;en&#383;ibility, grows callous
to the &#383;oft touches of humanity.</p>

<p>To part with Darnford was indeed
cruel.&mdash;It was to feel mo&#383;t painfully
alone; but &#383;he rejoiced to think, that
&#383;he &#383;hould &#383;pare him the care and perplexity
of the &#383;uit, and meet him again,
all his own. Marriage, as at pre&#383;ent
con&#383;tituted, &#383;he con&#383;idered as leading
to immorality&mdash;yet, as the odium of
&#383;ociety impedes u&#383;efulne&#383;s, &#383;he wi&#383;hed to
avow her affection to Darnford, by becoming
his wife according to e&#383;tabli&#383;hed
rules; not to be confounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-142_S" id="Pg_2-142_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-142.png">142</a>]</span>
with women who act from very different
motives, though her conduct would
be ju&#383;t the &#383;ame without the ceremony
as with it, and her expectations from
him not le&#383;s firm. The being &#383;ummoned
to defend her&#383;elf from a charge which
&#383;he was determined to plead guilty to,
was &#383;till galling, as it rou&#383;ed bitter reflections
on the &#383;ituation of women in
&#383;ociety.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XVII_S" id="CHAP_XVII_S"></a>CHAP. XVII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> was her &#383;tate of mind when
the dogs of law were let loo&#383;e on
her. Maria took the ta&#383;k of conducting
Darnford's defence upon her&#383;elf.
She in&#383;tructed his coun&#383;el to plead
guilty to the charge of adultery; but
to deny that of &#383;eduction.</p>

<p>The coun&#383;el for the plaintiff opened
the cau&#383;e, by ob&#383;erving, "that his client
had ever been an indulgent hu&#383;band,
and had borne with &#383;everal defects
of temper, while he had nothing
criminal to lay to the charge of his
wife. But that &#383;he left his hou&#383;e without
a&#383;&#383;igning any cau&#383;e. He could not
a&#383;&#383;ert that &#383;he was then acquainted
with the defendant; yet, when he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-144_S" id="Pg_2-144_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-144.png">144</a>]</span>
once endeavouring to bring her back
to her home, this man put the peace-officers
to flight, and took her he knew
not whither. After the birth of her child,
her conduct was &#383;o &#383;trange, and a melancholy
malady having afflicted one of
the family, which delicacy forbade the
dwelling on, it was nece&#383;&#383;ary to confine
her. By &#383;ome means the defendant
enabled her to make her e&#383;cape,
and they had lived together, in de&#383;pite
of all &#383;en&#383;e of order and decorum. The
adultery was allowed, it was not nece&#383;&#383;ary
to bring any witne&#383;&#383;es to prove it;
but the &#383;eduction, though highly probable
from the circum&#383;tances which
he had the honour to &#383;tate, could not
be &#383;o clearly proved.&mdash;It was of the
mo&#383;t atrocious kind, as decency was &#383;et
at defiance, and re&#383;pect for reputa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-145_S" id="Pg_2-145_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-145.png">145</a>]</span>tion,
which &#383;hows internal compunction,
utterly di&#383;regarded."</p>

<p>A &#383;trong &#383;en&#383;e of inju&#383;tice had &#383;ilenced
every emotion, which a mixture
of true and fal&#383;e delicacy might otherwi&#383;e
have excited in Maria's bo&#383;om.
She only felt in earne&#383;t to in&#383;i&#383;t on the
privilege of her nature. The &#383;arca&#383;ms
of &#383;ociety, and the condemnation of a
mi&#383;taken world, were nothing to her,
compared with acting contrary to tho&#383;e
feelings which were the foundation of
her principles. [She therefore eagerly
put her&#383;elf forward, in&#383;tead of de&#383;iring
to be ab&#383;ent, on this memorable occa&#383;ion.]</p>

<p>Convinced that the &#383;ubterfuges of
the law were di&#383;graceful, &#383;he wrote a
paper, which &#383;he expre&#383;&#383;ly de&#383;ired might
be read in court:</p>

<p>"Married when &#383;carcely able to di&#383;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-146_S" id="Pg_2-146_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-146.png">146</a>]</span>tingui&#383;h
the nature of the engagement,
I yet &#383;ubmitted to the rigid
laws which en&#383;lave women, and obeyed
the man whom I could no longer love.
Whether the duties of the &#383;tate are
reciprocal, I mean not to di&#383;cu&#383;s; but
I can prove repeated infidelities which
I overlooked or pardoned. Witne&#383;&#383;es
are not wanting to e&#383;tabli&#383;h the&#383;e facts.
I at pre&#383;ent maintain the child of a
maid &#383;ervant, &#383;worn to him, and born
after our marriage. I am ready to allow,
that education and circum&#383;tances
lead men to think and act with le&#383;s delicacy,
than the pre&#383;ervation of order
in &#383;ociety demands from women; but
&#383;urely I may without a&#383;&#383;umption declare,
that, though I could excu&#383;e the
birth, I could not the de&#383;ertion of this
unfortunate babe:&mdash;and, while I de&#383;pi&#383;ed
the man, it was not ea&#383;y to ve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-147_S" id="Pg_2-147_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-147.png">147</a>]</span>nerate
the hu&#383;band. With proper re&#383;trictions
however, I revere the in&#383;titution
which fraternizes the world. I exclaim
again&#383;t the laws which throw the
whole weight of the yoke on the weaker
&#383;houlders, and force women, when they
claim protector&#383;hip as mothers, to &#383;ign
a contract, which renders them dependent
on the caprice of the tyrant, whom
choice or nece&#383;&#383;ity has appointed to
reign over them. Various are the ca&#383;es,
in which a woman ought to &#383;eparate
her&#383;elf from her hu&#383;band; and mine,
I may be allowed emphatically to in&#383;i&#383;t,
comes under the de&#383;cription of the
mo&#383;t aggravated.</p>

<p>"I will not enlarge on tho&#383;e provocations
which only the individual can
e&#383;timate; but will bring forward &#383;uch
charges only, the truth of which is an
in&#383;ult upon humanity. In order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-148_S" id="Pg_2-148_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-148.png">148</a>]</span>
promote certain de&#383;tructive &#383;peculations,
Mr. Venables prevailed on me
to borrow certain &#383;ums of a wealthy relation;
and, when I refu&#383;ed further
compliance, he thought of bartering
my per&#383;on; and not only allowed opportunities
to, but urged, a friend
from whom he borrowed money, to
&#383;educe me. On the di&#383;covery of this
act of atrocity, I determined to leave
him, and in the mo&#383;t decided manner,
for ever. I con&#383;ider all obligation as
made void by his conduct; and hold,
that &#383;chi&#383;ms which proceed from want
of principles, can never be healed.</p>

<p>"He received a fortune with me to
the amount of five thou&#383;and pounds. On
the death of my uncle, convinced that
I could provide for my child, I de&#383;troyed
the &#383;ettlement of that fortune.
I required none of my property to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-149_S" id="Pg_2-149_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-149.png">149</a>]</span>
returned to me, nor &#383;hall enumerate the
&#383;ums extorted from me during &#383;ix years
that we lived together.</p>

<p>"After leaving, what the law con&#383;iders
as my home, I was hunted like a criminal
from place to place, though I
contracted no debts, and demanded no
maintenance&mdash;yet, as the laws &#383;anction
&#383;uch proceeding, and make women the
property of their hu&#383;bands, I forbear
to animadvert. After the birth of my
daughter, and the death of my uncle,
who left a very con&#383;iderable property
to my&#383;elf and child, I was expo&#383;ed to
new per&#383;ecution; and, becau&#383;e I had,
before arriving at what is termed years
of di&#383;cretion, pledged my faith, I was
treated by the world, as bound for ever
to a man who&#383;e vices were notorious.
Yet what are the vices generally
known, to the various mi&#383;eries that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-150_S" id="Pg_2-150_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-150.png">150</a>]</span>
woman may be &#383;ubject to, which,
though deeply felt, eating into the
&#383;oul, elude de&#383;cription, and may be
glo&#383;&#383;ed over! A fal&#383;e morality is even
e&#383;tabli&#383;hed, which makes all the virtue
of women con&#383;i&#383;t in cha&#383;tity, &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion,
and the forgivene&#383;s of injuries.</p>

<p>"I pardon my oppre&#383;&#383;or&mdash;bitterly as I
lament the lo&#383;s of my child, torn from
me in the mo&#383;t violent manner. But
nature revolts, and my &#383;oul &#383;ickens at
the bare &#383;uppo&#383;ition, that it could ever
be a duty to pretend affection, when a
&#383;eparation is nece&#383;&#383;ary to prevent my
feeling hourly aver&#383;ion.</p>

<p>"To force me to give my fortune, I
was impri&#383;oned&mdash;yes; in a private mad-hou&#383;e.&mdash;There,
in the heart of mi&#383;ery,
I met the man charged with &#383;educing
me. We became attached&mdash;I deemed,
and ever &#383;hall deem, my&#383;elf free. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-151_S" id="Pg_2-151_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-151.png">151</a>]</span>
death of my babe di&#383;&#383;olved the only tie
which &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;ted between me and my,
what is termed, lawful hu&#383;band.</p>

<p>"To this per&#383;on, thus encountered,
I voluntarily gave my&#383;elf, never con&#383;idering
my&#383;elf as any more bound to
tran&#383;gre&#383;s the laws of moral purity,
becau&#383;e the will of my hu&#383;band
might be pleaded in my excu&#383;e, than
to tran&#383;gre&#383;s tho&#383;e laws to which
[the policy of artificial &#383;ociety has]
annexed [po&#383;itive] puni&#383;hments.&mdash;&mdash;While
no command of a hu&#383;band can
prevent a woman from &#383;uffering for
certain crimes, &#383;he mu&#383;t be allowed
to con&#383;ult her con&#383;cience, and regulate
her conduct, in &#383;ome degree, by her
own &#383;en&#383;e of right. The re&#383;pect I owe
to my&#383;elf, demanded my &#383;trict adherence
to my determination of never
viewing Mr. Venables in the light of a
hu&#383;band, nor could it forbid me from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-152_S" id="Pg_2-152_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-152.png">152</a>]</span>
encouraging another. If I am unfortunately
united to an unprincipled man,
am I for ever to be &#383;hut out from fulfilling
the duties of a wife and mother?&mdash;I
wi&#383;h my country to approve of my
conduct; but, if laws exi&#383;t, made by
the &#383;trong to oppre&#383;s the weak, I appeal
to my own &#383;en&#383;e of ju&#383;tice, and
declare that I will not live with the
individual, who has violated every moral
obligation which binds man to man.</p>

<p>"I prote&#383;t equally again&#383;t any charge
being brought to criminate the man,
whom I con&#383;ider as my hu&#383;band. I
was &#383;ix-and-twenty when I left Mr.
Venables' roof; if ever I am to be &#383;uppo&#383;ed
to arrive at an age to direct my
own actions, I mu&#383;t by that time have
arrived at it.&mdash;I acted with deliberation.&mdash;Mr.
Darnford found me a forlorn
and oppre&#383;&#383;ed woman, and promi&#383;ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-153_S" id="Pg_2-153_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-153.png">153</a>]</span>
the protection women in the pre&#383;ent
&#383;tate of &#383;ociety want.&mdash;But the man
who now claims me&mdash;was he deprived
of my &#383;ociety by this conduct? The
que&#383;tion is an in&#383;ult to common &#383;en&#383;e,
con&#383;idering where Mr. Darnford met
me.&mdash;Mr. Venables' door was indeed
open to me&mdash;nay, threats and intreaties
were u&#383;ed to induce me to return; but
why? Was affection or honour the
motive?&mdash;I cannot, it is true, dive into
the rece&#383;&#383;es of the human heart&mdash;yet
I pre&#383;ume to a&#383;&#383;ert, [borne out as
I am by a variety of circum&#383;tances,]
that he was merely influenced by the
mo&#383;t rapacious avarice.</p>

<p>"I claim then a divorce, and the
liberty of enjoying, free from mole&#383;tation,
the fortune left to me by a relation,
who was well aware of the character
of the man with whom I had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-154_S" id="Pg_2-154_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-154.png">154</a>]</span>
contend.&mdash;I appeal to the ju&#383;tice and
humanity of the jury&mdash;a body of men,
who&#383;e private judgment mu&#383;t be allowed
to modify laws, that mu&#383;t be
unju&#383;t, becau&#383;e definite rules can never
apply to indefinite circum&#383;tances&mdash;and
I deprecate puni&#383;hment upon the man
of my choice, freeing him, as I &#383;olemnly
do, from the charge of &#383;eduction.]</p>

<p>"I did not put my&#383;elf into a &#383;ituation
to ju&#383;tify a charge of adultery, till
I had, from conviction, &#383;haken off the
fetters which bound me to Mr. Venables.&mdash;While
I lived with him, I defy
the voice of calumny to &#383;ully what is
termed the fair fame of woman.&mdash;Neglected
by my hu&#383;band, I never encouraged
a lover; and pre&#383;erved with
&#383;crupulous care, what is termed my
honour, at the expence of my peace,
till he, who &#383;hould have been its guar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-155_S" id="Pg_2-155_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-155.png">155</a>]</span>dian,
laid traps to en&#383;nare me. From
that moment I believed my&#383;elf, in the
&#383;ight of heaven, free&mdash;and no power
on earth &#383;hall force me to renounce my
re&#383;olution."</p>

<p>The judge, in &#383;umming up the evidence,
alluded to "the fallacy of letting
women plead their feelings, as an excu&#383;e
for the violation of the marriage-vow.
For his part, he had always
determined to oppo&#383;e all innovation,
and the new-fangled notions which incroached
on the good old rules of conduct.
We did not want French principles
in public or private life&mdash;and, if
women were allowed to plead their
feelings, as an excu&#383;e or palliation of
infidelity, it was opening a flood-gate
for immorality. What virtuous woman
thought of her feelings?&mdash;It was
her duty to love and obey the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-156_S" id="Pg_2-156_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-156.png">156</a>]</span>
cho&#383;en by her parents and relations,
who were qualified by their experience
to judge better for her, than &#383;he could
for her&#383;elf. As to the charges brought
again&#383;t the hu&#383;band, they were vague,
&#383;upported by no witne&#383;&#383;es, excepting
that of impri&#383;onment in a private mad-hou&#383;e.
The proofs of an in&#383;anity in the
family, might render that however a
prudent mea&#383;ure; and indeed the conduct
of the lady did not appear that of
a per&#383;on of &#383;ane mind. Still &#383;uch a
mode of proceeding could not be ju&#383;tified,
and might perhaps entitle the
lady [in another court] to a &#383;entence of
&#383;eparation from bed and board, during
the joint lives of the parties; but he
hoped that no Engli&#383;hman would legalize
adultery, by enabling the adultere&#383;s
to enrich her &#383;educer. Too many re&#383;trictions
could not be thrown in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-157_S" id="Pg_2-157_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-157.png">157</a>]</span>
way of divorces, if we wi&#383;hed to maintain
the &#383;anctity of marriage; and,
though they might bear a little hard on
a few, very few individuals, it was
evidently for the good of the whole."</p>

<p>"She &#383;wallowed the laudanum; her
&#383;oul was calm&mdash;the tempe&#383;t had &#383;ub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-162_S" id="Pg_2-162_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-162.png">162</a>]</span>&#383;ided&mdash;and

fly from the angui&#383;h &#383;he endured
to e&#383;cape from thought&mdash;from this
hell of di&#383;appointment.</p>

<p>"Still her eyes clo&#383;ed not&mdash;one remembrance
with frightful velocity followed
another&mdash;All the incidents of
her life were in arms, embodied to
a&#383;&#383;ail her, and prevent her &#383;inking
into the &#383;leep of death.&mdash;Her murdered
child again appeared to her,
mourning for the babe of which &#383;he
was the tomb.&mdash;'And could it have
a nobler?&mdash;Surely it is better to die
with me, than to enter on life without
a mother's care!&mdash;I cannot live!&mdash;but
could I have de&#383;erted my child the
moment it was born?&mdash;thrown it on
the troubled wave of life, without
a hand to &#383;upport it?'&mdash;She looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-163_S" id="Pg_2-163_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-163.png">163</a>]</span>
up: 'What have I not &#383;uffered!&mdash;may
I find a father where I am going!'&mdash;Her
head turned; a &#383;tupor en&#383;ued;
a faintne&#383;s&mdash;'Have a little patience,'
&#383;aid Maria, holding her &#383;wimming
head (&#383;he thought of her mother),
'this cannot la&#383;t long; and what is a
little bodily pain to the pangs I have
endured?'</p>

<p>"A new vi&#383;ion &#383;wam before her.
Jemima &#383;eemed to enter&mdash;leading a little
creature, that, with tottering foot&#383;teps,
approached the bed. The voice
of Jemima &#383;ounding as at a di&#383;tance,
called her&mdash;&#383;he tried to li&#383;ten, to &#383;peak,
to look!</p>

<p>"'Behold your child!' exclaimed
Jemima. Maria &#383;tarted off the bed,
and fainted.&mdash;Violent vomiting followed.</p>

<p>"When &#383;he was re&#383;tored to life, Je<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-164_S" id="Pg_2-164_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-164.png">164</a>]</span>mima
addre&#383;&#383;ed her with great &#383;olemnity:
'&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; led me to &#383;u&#383;pect,
that your hu&#383;band and brother had
deceived you, and &#383;ecreted the child.
I would not torment you with doubtful
hopes, and I left you (at a fatal
moment) to &#383;earch for the child!&mdash;I
&#383;natched her from mi&#383;ery&mdash;and (now
&#383;he is alive again) would you leave
her alone in the world, to endure what
I have endured?'</p>

<p>"Maria gazed wildly at her, her
whole frame was convul&#383;ed with emotion;
when the child, whom Jemima
had been tutoring all the journey, uttered
the word 'Mamma!' She
caught her to her bo&#383;om, and bur&#383;t
into a pa&#383;&#383;ion of tears&mdash;then, re&#383;ting
the child gently on the bed, as if
afraid of killing it,&mdash;&#383;he put her hand
to her eyes, to conceal as it were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-165_S" id="Pg_2-165_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-165.png">165</a>]</span>
agonizing &#383;truggle of her &#383;oul. She
remained &#383;ilent for five minutes, cro&#383;&#383;ing
her arms over her bo&#383;om, and reclining
her head,&mdash;then exclaimed:
'The conflict is over!&mdash;I will live for
my child!'"</p>

<hr />

<p>A few readers perhaps, in looking
over the&#383;e hints, will wonder how it
could have been practicable, without
tediou&#383;ne&#383;s, or remitting in any degree
the intere&#383;t of the &#383;tory, to have filled,
from the&#383;e &#383;light &#383;ketches, a number of
pages, more con&#383;iderable than tho&#383;e
which have been already pre&#383;ented.
But, in reality, the&#383;e hints, &#383;imple as
they are, are pregnant with pa&#383;&#383;ion and
di&#383;tre&#383;s. It is the refuge of barren au<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-166_S" id="Pg_2-166_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-166.png">166</a>]</span>thors
only, to crowd their fictions with
&#383;o great a number of events, as to &#383;uffer
no one of them to &#383;ink into the reader's
mind. It is the province of true genius
to develop events, to di&#383;cover their
capabilities, to a&#383;certain the different
pa&#383;&#383;ions and &#383;entiments with which they
are fraught, and to diver&#383;ify them with
incidents, that give reality to the picture,
and take a hold upon the mind of a
reader of ta&#383;te, from which they can
never be loo&#383;ened. It was particularly
the de&#383;ign of the author, in the pre&#383;ent
in&#383;tance, to make her &#383;tory &#383;ubordinate
to a great moral purpo&#383;e, that "of exhibiting
the mi&#383;ery and oppre&#383;&#383;ion, peculiar
to women, that ari&#383;e out of the
partial laws and cu&#383;toms of &#383;ociety.&mdash;This
view re&#383;trained her fancy<a name="FNanchor_166-A_10_S" id="FNanchor_166-A_10_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_166-A_10_S" class="fnanchor">[166-A]</a>." It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-167_S" id="Pg_2-167_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-167.png">167</a>]</span>
was nece&#383;&#383;ary for her, to place in a &#383;triking
point of view, evils that are too
frequently overlooked, and to drag into
light tho&#383;e details of oppre&#383;&#383;ion, of
which the gro&#383;&#383;er and more in&#383;en&#383;ible
part of mankind make little account.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages will, I believe,
be judged by every reader of ta&#383;te to
have been worth pre&#383;erving, among
the other te&#383;timonies the author left

&#383;oundne&#383;s of her under&#383;tanding. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-172_S" id="Pg_2-172_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-172.png">172</a>]</span>
&#383;uch readers I leave the ta&#383;k of comparing
the&#383;e le&#383;&#383;ons, with other works
of the &#383;ame nature previou&#383;ly publi&#383;hed.
It is obvious that the author has &#383;truck
out a path of her own, and by no means
intrenched upon the plans of her predece&#383;&#383;ors.</p>

<p>It may however excite &#383;urpri&#383;e in
&#383;ome per&#383;ons to find the&#383;e papers annexed
to the conclu&#383;ion of a novel. All
I have to offer on this &#383;ubject, con&#383;i&#383;ts
in the following con&#383;iderations:</p>

<p>Fir&#383;t, &#383;omething is to be allowed for
the difficulty of arranging the mi&#383;cellaneous
papers upon very different &#383;ub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-173_S" id="Pg_2-173_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-173.png">173</a>]</span>jects,
which will frequently con&#383;titute
an author's po&#383;thumous works.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Secondly, the &#383;mall portion they occupy
in the pre&#383;ent volume, will perhaps
be accepted as an apology, by
&#383;uch good-natured readers (if any &#383;uch
there are), to whom the peru&#383;al of
them &#383;hall be a matter of perfect indifference.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Thirdly, the circum&#383;tance which
determined me in annexing them to
the pre&#383;ent work, was the &#383;light a&#383;&#383;ociation
(in default of a &#383;trong one)
between the affectionate and pathetic
manner in which Maria Venables ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-174_S" id="Pg_2-174_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-174.png">174</a>]</span>dre&#383;&#383;es
her infant, in the Wrongs of
Woman; and the agoni&#383;ing and painful

when you were lying, like William, on
my knee. So I put you to my brea&#383;t,
and you &#383;ucked, as the puppy &#383;ucks
now, for there was milk enough for
you.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VII.</p>

<p>WHEN you were hungry, you began
to cry, becau&#383;e you could not &#383;peak.
You were &#383;even months without teeth,
always &#383;ucking. But after you got
one, you began to gnaw a cru&#383;t of
bread. It was not long before another
came pop. At ten months you had
four pretty white teeth, and you u&#383;ed
to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did
not cry, becau&#383;e I am not a child, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-182_S" id="Pg_2-182_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-182.png">182</a>]</span>
you hurt me very much. So I &#383;aid to
papa, it is time the little girl &#383;hould
eat. She is not naughty, yet &#383;he hurts
me. I have given her a cru&#383;t of bread,
and I mu&#383;t look for &#383;ome other milk.</p>

<p>The cow has got plenty, and her
jumping calf eats gra&#383;s very well. He
has got more teeth than my little girl.
Yes, &#383;ays papa, and he tapped you on
the cheek, you are old enough to learn
to eat? Come to me, and I will teach
you, my little dear, for you mu&#383;t not
hurt poor mamma, who has given you
her milk, when you could not take any
thing el&#383;e.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VIII.</p>

<p>YOU were then on the carpet, for
you could not walk well. So when
you were in a hurry, you u&#383;ed to run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-183_S" id="Pg_2-183_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-183.png">183</a>]</span>
quick, quick, quick, on your hands
and feet, like the dog.</p>

<p>Away you ran to papa, and putting
both your arms round his leg, for your
hands were not big enough, you looked
up at him, and laughed. What did
this laugh &#383;ay, when you could not
&#383;peak? Cannot you gue&#383;s by what you
now &#383;ay to papa?&mdash;Ah! it was, Play
with me, papa!&mdash;play with me!</p>

<p>Papa began to &#383;mile, and you knew
that the &#383;mile was always&mdash;Yes. So
you got a ball, and papa threw it along
the floor&mdash;Roll&mdash;roll&mdash;roll; and you
ran after it again&mdash;and again. How
plea&#383;ed you were. Look at William,
he &#383;miles; but you could laugh loud&mdash;Ha!
ha! ha!&mdash;Papa laughed louder
than the little girl, and rolled the ball
&#383;till fa&#383;ter.</p>

<p>Then he put the ball on a chair, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-184_S" id="Pg_2-184_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-184.png">184</a>]</span>
you were forced to take hold of the
back, and &#383;tand up to reach it. At
la&#383;t you reached too far, and down you
fell: not indeed on your face, becau&#383;e
you put out your hands. You were not
much hurt; but the palms of your
hands &#383;marted with the pain, and you
began to cry, like a little child.</p>

<p>It is only very little children who cry
when they are hurt; and it is to tell
their mamma, that &#383;omething is the
matter with them. Now you can come
to me, and &#383;ay, Mamma, I have hurt
my&#383;elf. Pray rub my hand: it &#383;marts.
Put &#383;omething on it, to make it well.
A piece of rag, to &#383;top the blood.
You are not afraid of a little blood&mdash;not
you. You &#383;cratched your arm with
a pin: it bled a little; but it did you
no harm. See, the &#383;kin is grown over
it again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-185_S" id="Pg_2-185_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-185.png">185</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">LESSON IX.</p>

<p>TAKE care not to put pins in your
mouth, becau&#383;e they will &#383;tick in your
throat, and give you pain. Oh! you
cannot think what pain a pin would
give you in your throat, &#383;hould it remain
there: but, if you by chance
&#383;wallow it, I &#383;hould be obliged to give
you, every morning, &#383;omething bitter
to drink. You never ta&#383;ted any thing
&#383;o bitter! and you would grow very
&#383;ick. I never put pins in my mouth;
but I am older than you, and know how
to take care of my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>My mamma took care of me, when I
was a little girl, like you. She bade
me never put any thing in my mouth,
without a&#383;king her what it was.</p>

<p>When you were a baby, with no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-186_S" id="Pg_2-186_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-186.png">186</a>]</span>
&#383;en&#383;e than William, you put every thing
in your mouth to gnaw, to help your
teeth to cut through the &#383;kin. Look
at the puppy, how he bites that piece
of wood. William pre&#383;&#383;es his gums
again&#383;t my finger. Poor boy! he is &#383;o
young, he does not know what he is
doing. When you bite any thing, it is
becau&#383;e you are hungry.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON X.</p>

<p>SEE how much taller you are than
William. In four years you have learned
to eat, to walk, to talk. Why do you
&#383;mile? You can do much more, you
think: you can wa&#383;h your hands and
face. Very well. I &#383;hould never ki&#383;s
a dirty face. And you can comb your
head with the pretty comb you always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-187_S" id="Pg_2-187_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-187.png">187</a>]</span>
put by in your own drawer. To be
&#383;ure, you do all this to be ready to take
a walk with me. You would be obliged
to &#383;tay at home, if you could not comb
your own hair. Betty is bu&#383;y getting
the dinner ready, and only bru&#383;hes
William's hair, becau&#383;e he cannot do it
for him&#383;elf.</p>

<p>Betty is making an apple-pye. You
love an apple-pye; but I do not bid
you make one. Your hands are not
&#383;trong enough to mix the butter and
flour together; and you mu&#383;t not try to
pare the apples, becau&#383;e you cannot
manage a great knife.</p>

<p>Never touch the large knives: they
are very &#383;harp, and you might cut your
finger to the bone. You are a little
girl, and ought to have a little knife.
When you are as tall as I am, you &#383;hall
have a knife as large as mine; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-188_S" id="Pg_2-188_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-188.png">188</a>]</span>
when you are as &#383;trong as I am, and
have learned to manage it, you will not
hurt your&#383;elf.</p>

<p>You can trundle a hoop, you &#383;ay;
and jump over a &#383;tick. O, I forgot!&mdash;and
march like the men in the red
coats, when papa plays a pretty tune on
the fiddle.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XI.</p>

<p>WHAT, you think that you &#383;hall
&#383;oon be able to dre&#383;s your&#383;elf entirely?
I am glad of it: I have &#383;omething el&#383;e
to do. You may go, and look for your
frock in the drawer; but I will tie it,
till you are &#383;tronger. Betty will tie it,
when I am bu&#383;y.</p>

<p>I button my gown my&#383;elf: I do not
want a maid to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t me, when I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-189_S" id="Pg_2-189_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-189.png">189</a>]</span>
dre&#383;&#383;ing. But you have not yet got
&#383;en&#383;e enough to do it properly, and
mu&#383;t beg &#383;omebody to help you, till you
are older.</p>

<p>Children grow older and wi&#383;er at the
&#383;ame time. William is not able to take
a piece of meat, becau&#383;e he has not got
the &#383;en&#383;e which would make him think
that, without teeth, meat would do him
harm. He cannot tell what is good for
him.</p>

<p>The &#383;en&#383;e of children grows with
them. You know much more than
William, now you walk alone, and talk;
but you do not know as much as the
boys and girls you &#383;ee playing yonder,
who are half as tall again as you; and
they do not know half as much as their
fathers and mothers, who are men and
women grown. Papa and I were children,
like you; and men and women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-190_S" id="Pg_2-190_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-190.png">190</a>]</span>
took care of us. I carry William, becau&#383;e
he is too weak to walk. I lift
you over a &#383;tile, and over the gutter,
when you cannot jump over it.</p>

<p>You know already, that potatoes
will not do you any harm: but I mu&#383;t
pluck the fruit for you, till you are wi&#383;e
enough to know the ripe apples and
pears. The hard ones would make you
&#383;ick, and then you mu&#383;t take phy&#383;ic.
You do not love phy&#383;ic: I do not love
it any more than you. But I have more
&#383;en&#383;e than you; therefore I take care
not to eat unripe fruit, or any thing el&#383;e
that would make my &#383;tomach ache, or
bring out ugly red &#383;pots on my face.</p>

<p>When I was a child, my mamma
cho&#383;e the fruit for me, to prevent my
making my&#383;elf &#383;ick. I was ju&#383;t like
you; I u&#383;ed to a&#383;k for what I &#383;aw, without
knowing whether it was good or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-191_S" id="Pg_2-191_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-191.png">191</a>]</span>
bad. Now I have lived a long time, I
know what is good; I do not want any
body to tell me.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XII.</p>

<p>LOOK at tho&#383;e two dogs. The old
one brings the ball to me in a moment;
the young one does not know how.
He mu&#383;t be taught.</p>

<p>I can cut your &#383;hift in a proper &#383;hape.
You would not know how to begin.
You would &#383;poil it; but you will learn.</p>

<p>John digs in the garden, and knows
when to put the &#383;eed in the ground.
You cannot tell whether it &#383;hould be in
the winter or &#383;ummer. Try to find it
out. When do the trees put out their
leaves? In the &#383;pring, you &#383;ay, after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-192_S" id="Pg_2-192_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-192.png">192</a>]</span>
cold weather. Fruit would not grow
ripe without very warm weather. Now
I am &#383;ure you can gue&#383;s why the &#383;ummer
is the &#383;ea&#383;on for fruit.</p>

<p>Papa knows that peas and beans are
good for us to eat with our meat. You
are glad when you &#383;ee them; but if he
did not think for you, and have the
&#383;eed put in the ground, we &#383;hould have
no peas or beans.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XIII.</p>

<p>POOR child, &#383;he cannot do much for
her&#383;elf. When I let her do any thing
for me, it is to plea&#383;e her: for I could
do it better my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>Oh! the poor puppy has tumbled
off the &#383;tool. Run and &#383;troak him. Put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-193_S" id="Pg_2-193_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-193.png">193</a>]</span>
a little milk in a &#383;aucer to comfort him.
You have more &#383;en&#383;e than he. You
can pour the milk into the &#383;aucer without
&#383;pilling it. He would cry for a day
with hunger, without being able to get
it. You are wi&#383;er than the dog, you
mu&#383;t help him. The dog will love you
for it, and run after you. I feed you
and take care of you: you love me
and follow me for it.</p>

<p>When the book fell down on your
foot, it gave you great pain. The poor
dog felt the &#383;ame pain ju&#383;t now.</p>

<p>Take care not to hurt him when you
play with him. And every morning
leave a little milk in your ba&#383;on for
him. Do not forget to put the ba&#383;on
in a corner, le&#383;t &#383;omebody &#383;hould fall
over it.</p>

<p>When the &#383;now covers the ground,
&#383;ave the crumbs of bread for the birds.
In the &#383;ummer they find feed enough,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-194_S" id="Pg_2-194_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-194.png">194</a>]</span>
and do not want you to think about
them.</p>

<p>I make broth for the poor man who
is &#383;ick. A &#383;ick man is like a child, he
cannot help him&#383;elf.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON X.</p>

<p>WHEN I caught cold &#383;ome time
ago, I had &#383;uch a pain in my head, I
could &#383;carcely hold it up. Papa
opened the door very &#383;oftly, becau&#383;e
he loves me. You love me, yet you
made a noi&#383;e. You had not the &#383;en&#383;e
to know that it made my head wor&#383;e,
till papa told you.</p>

<p>Papa had a pain in the &#383;tomach, and
he would not eat the fine cherries or
grapes on the table. When I brought
him a cup of camomile tea, he drank
it without &#383;aying a word, or making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-195_S" id="Pg_2-195_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-195.png">195</a>]</span>
an ugly face. He knows that I love
him, and that I would not give him
any thing to drink that has a bad ta&#383;te,
if it were not to do him good.</p>

<p>You a&#383;ked me for &#383;ome apples when
your &#383;tomach ached; but I was not angry
with you. If you had been as wi&#383;e
as papa, you would have &#383;aid, I will
not eat the apples to-day, I mu&#383;t take
&#383;ome camomile tea.</p>

<p>You &#383;ay that you do not know how
to think. Yes; you do a little. The
other day papa was tired; he had been
walking about all the morning. After
dinner he fell a&#383;leep on the &#383;opha. I
did not bid you be quiet; but you
thought of what papa &#383;aid to you,
when my head ached. This made you
think that you ought not to make a
noi&#383;e, when papa was re&#383;ting him&#383;elf.
So you came to me, and &#383;aid to me,
very &#383;oftly, Pray reach me my ball, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-196_S" id="Pg_2-196_S"></a>[<a href="./images/v2-196.png">196</a>]</span>
I will go and play in the garden, till
papa wakes.</p>

<p>You were going out; but thinking
again, you came back to me on your
tip-toes. Whi&#383;per&mdash;&mdash;whi&#383;per. Pray
mama, call me, when papa wakes;
for I &#383;hall be afraid to open the door
to &#383;ee, le&#383;t I &#383;hould di&#383;turb him.</p>

<p>Away you went.&mdash;Creep&mdash;creep&mdash;and
&#383;hut the door as &#383;oftly as I could
have done my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>That was thinking. When a child
does wrong at fir&#383;t, &#383;he does not know
any better. But, after &#383;he has been told
that &#383;he mu&#383;t not di&#383;turb mama, when
poor mama is unwell, &#383;he thinks her&#383;elf,
that &#383;he mu&#383;t not wake papa when
he is tired.</p>

<p>Another day we will &#383;ee if you can
think about any thing el&#383;e.</p>
